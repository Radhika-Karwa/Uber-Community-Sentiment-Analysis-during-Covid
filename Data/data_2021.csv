post-7029729,touberornottouber,"Apr 14, 2021 at 12:00 PM","I get a ride request to go to an apartment. When I arrive it shows me that it is a scheduled ride for 9:45 - 9:55. It is 9:46 so I message them to let them know i am in front of the building (there are 30 buildings in this complex and the GPS is often off). She messages back that she will need a couple minutes. I say ""no problem"" because I can live with 2-3 minutes. But then she messages back that she ""uses the scheduled rides to give her some extra leeway"". (she is thinking that she has until 9:55 to come out and is starting to get snooty with me). I consider messaging back to tell her, no, she misunderstood how it works but thought better of it as you never know how they will react. I also consider whether I should just cancel the ride then and there and leave to avoid having to deal with her but decide to let it go.

It finally tells me I can now cancel and get paid. I decide to wait an extra three minutes just to be a nice guy (I really am not a jerk honest). Finally I am over 8 minutes in now. It's 9:54 so I cancel.

She was going to wait to 9:55 to ""show me"" and make me wait for being ""impatient"". I wonder how that worked out for her? I drove away about $4.50 richer.

Here's one I had with the longest ping I've ever gotten. 34 minutes and probably 30 miles to pick up a pax. Yeah, I'll get right on that!  





Here's one where my AR and CR both plummeted to 0%. Good for the CR but wow. I didn't know I was turning down that many rides. Turns out it was a glitch of course. Returned to normal the next day.




Anyone getting these crazy long waits for scheduled rides lately? I've made a habit of checking beforehand because Uber will sometimes send me to a pax when there's as much as 30 minutes before their scheduled ride. Wow. Just wow. Needless to say, I cancelled with a ""don't want to wait"".

I drive in Chicago, and today I had someone named ozasee for a ride. I discovered he wasn't wearing a mask, and refused to put one on. Once he did, it was under his chin, and I repeatedly asked him to put it on. He put it under his nose, and started complaining about Chicago not having a mask mandate. I explained it was Uber's policy, and Chicago had nothing to do with it. He refused to put it on, so I pulled over to a gas station, and ended the ride. He then refused to get out of the car, and I had to call the police. This is how my day started today. His pickup location was . He was verbally abusive about getting out of the car, and wouldn't get out. Uber sent him a message reminding him about the mask, and he will have to prove with a photo that he's wearing a mask before getting a ride. Nothing about him being rude or anything from Uber. Stupid useless people in that company. Just be warned about this person named ozasee in Chicago.",2021

As some know here, I decided to go and get a ""real job"" like my wife had been ""suggesting"".

""You know, a W-2. No, I don't care if you don't want to flip burgers! 

Well, I thought that I was doing pretty well driving Uber (after expenses, still about what I earned as a paramedic) but my 2018 Civic hit 70k and gas prices are through the roof.

So, ""real job"".

Back to EMS? Still a maybe. But I'm not in my 20s anymore, a touch of PTSD, and two hernias.

Back to programming? Competitive, also for the young, and I do not want to be behind a desk.

Law enforcement? That was on my horizon before we moved to the big city and ""stuff"" happened.

So, one night, I decided to send a Facebook message to a limousine company that I first noticed before I started rideshare full time, brand new to the city life. Instant reply, I was hired on the spot two days later.

First vehicle I drove was a Chrysler 300. Brakes were shot. Second, another 300, tires were bald and one had an enormous chunk of rubber missing.

Soul searched for about three days (and posted here). Decided to give them the benefit of doubt, just as I would want, emailed them basically saying that they are awesome but I can't drive unsafe shit.

Owner's girlfriend stepped in, took care of everything like a boss, and I am now driving their best. The pandemic nearly killed their business, that section of the fleet is just now becoming more in demand.

Now, Winifred. She had just become a regular when I started - very ""well to do"". First trip was from an independent care facility (now assisted living unit, she's not happy) to the afternoon Mass.

I was warned in advance (and given a salute by her last driver) before I headed to pick her up - third trip for the company. Very demanding pax and she needs a lot of help getting in and out of the car.

She asked me to do five things at once, said she's old enough to be my grandmother (Mom's her age), AC was either too hot or too cold, and made me pull over to find the right radio station. All in the first five minutes 😂

First time waiting for a pax on the job. People were commenting on the fancy car parked by the door to the church. It was her first Mass since the pandemic began.

After I got her situated in the car again, she started to apologize for how she acted before. I cut her off. Told her that I know chronic pain when I see it (arthritic, obese) and how it can definitely **** with your mood. And I told her to stop calling herself old.

Dropped her off, called the company, and told them that if Winifred ever needs a ride to PLEASE let me know. And she requested me for her next trip.

Mass again yesterday, this time I joined her. Boss asked if we needed to charge extra for an escort. 😂

And that's my Sunday moving forward. Paid a decent amount to drive a friend (Winifred said I'd better not think of her as a pax) to church and back.

Oh, and here I am picking up her phone off of the road yesterday because I put it on the roof and forgot. Not a scratch. Divine intervention??😳




Rideshare has been either extremely profitable here or less than minimum wage, just seems to be how the wind blows. Tips are pretty much unheard of, pick up distance is still pretty high for most pings. Pax are still left stranded at our airport.

Even though I'm not totally down with it (seems a bit low), I earn $10/hr from when I leave the ""garage"" (that can be home if the car isn't needed before or between trips) until I return.

unlike Uber and Lyft, tips are included, minimum of 18% - and many fares are $200+. So, no dead miles and no expenses. Lately driving a 2019 Lincoln MKT, 2017 Continental, 2019 Suburban, and soon a 2020 Continental.

Pax run the gamut, from Winifred to newlyweds, executives, flight crews (airport to hotel and back), organ transplant teams, and - last week - a show creator for AMC followed by his lead actor.

I was star struck enough, then had the surreal experience of the main man behind the show asking me to stop so he could literally run a block to an ATM so he could tip me $20 cash (in addition to the $20 or so included, short airport run).

In conclusion, companies like this are hiring. ""Oh, rideshare drivers are un employable"" - bullshit. I submitted a resume, showed up on time wearing a suit, ""here's where the keys are, water bottles are over there, when can you start"" - that was the interview.

So, if you are burnt out being an ""ant"" (hate that term but whatever), consider the option. And I'm part time for now, still ""anting"" on and off.

My theme song right now -

post-7131597,Cvillegordo,"Jul 6, 2021 at 11:40 AM","I've been driving in the Charlottesville Virginia area since the fall of 2019. I have taken rides to Richmond Harrisonburg and Stanton and picked up rides in those areas on the way back. I've also gone as far North as Culpeper but did not get any pings on the way back from there. My understanding has always been that if I were to take a longer trip for example to Dulles airport, that I could set my destination to return and possibly get trips along the way. I have never done this because it doesn't seem to make sense financially, Is too much time and too many dead miles. I've always assumed that I'm not authorized to drive in that area, other than in a return situation. Yesterday I had a conversation with support about my annual inspection. I uploaded the new certificate and they did not automatically lift the hold; I had to call them. After the rep helps me out she did confirm that my area includes anywhere in Virginia. She also said that if I can go online that means I can get trips. My wife and I are in NoVA, DC and Maryland 2 to 4 days a week for her work. I always play with the app to look at surges and so forth, and I have always been able to go online in those areas; I haven't tried to actually take trips or pings simply because I've never been in my car, I'm always in my wife's company car but theoretically I COULD take my car, I spend 4-8 hours amusing myself while she works, the idea is tempting, except for the problem of putting huge miles on my car just for a few bucks.. Support has told me quite a number of incorrect things in the past so is this person correct or is this person confused? Is it true that if you can go online, you will get pings? When my inspection was expired for the last several days, I could still go online - I just wasn't getting any pings. So that tends to refute the information that support told me already.

Doors are locked, I roll down window and ask are you wet, you can't get in if you are wet. If you are still wet I have extra towels in the back. Guy replies no they are not wet. I repeat I have extra towels in the back you can sit on. He says no we are not wet. 

I open the doors and they get in. Take them several miles to a resort. Talk about how people want to get in while wet and I can't drive anymore until my seats dry. She gets out and her towel falls off, okay string bikini the size of yarn explains why she was wrapped up in a towel. I pull away and decided I better check the seat behind me. Idiot lied, I could clearly see where his bathing suit was wet and left my seat wet.

I turn the app off, take pictures and send in a urine complaint to Uber, after all he said he was not wet so he must have pissed his pants.

Took about two hours for Uber to respond along with $10 for cleaning fee and 5 extra Uber Pro points would be added to my total. Replied back that I had to have my seat cleaned as he pissed in it and they replied back that rider claimed his bathing suite must have been wet from swimming. I replied back with the conversation I had with the rider and also uploaded the video and sent them a link. Explained the video clearly shows he said he was not wet.

But I can't fathom why anyone would use this service. As a user of the Uber rider app, I have been getting deluged with emailed coupons to try Eats ""for free"". But free doesn't include the many many ancillary charges like service fees. First I tried to use a $30 coupon and got this:

Was given a nearly 2-hour delivery window. Two hours later the order was cancelled on a ""your order could not be delivered"" error.

Tried the $25 coupon again for $26 of food. The free meal was going to cost nearly $10. Coupon or no coupon the misc chargers are hilarious:

I am in line and there is this middle ages black guy in front of me. In front of him was this overweight guy. As the overweight customer is getting rung up, he all of a sudden went on some kind of fart storm. Like if you ate a lot of chili with beans in it and you just have a lot of gas with no expectation of using the bathroom. Just pressure and air.

So it basically went like this.....
<loud fart sound then stops>
""Oh god sorry i'm really sorry""
<more fart sounds after that then stop>
""Oh geez I am really sorry like oh my <fart sound> god""
<more farting>

The black guy in front of me turns around with such a disgusted look on his face like he was in the car driving past the sewage treatment plant on a hot day with the windows down.

Then he speaks LOUDLY while also using his hands in an explaining way....
<black guy voice with actual tactful pausing>
""You know... it smells like... someone is taking a poop... right here...
<points down with two fingers>
Like... I am standing in the bathroom stall... right next to the guy... who has food poisoning... and taking a massive diarrhea dump""

I busted out laughing so hard I had to grab the chip rack to keep me from falling. The entire store was laughing hysterically. The farting guy left real fast all embarrassed. It did stink in that general area from the farts. When the black guy gets up to the counter to pay, a woman behind me walks past me and offers to pay and thanks him for making her laugh so hard it made her day.

post-7127070,_Tron_,"Jul 1, 2021 at 11:38 AM","Uber badly wants me to drive again. It keeps sending incentive notices to my inbox. So as it happens I have been driving. Since last in the saddle I have lost Gold status, and my ability to see the destination of a ride request is now based upon the newish accepting 5 of 10 ride requests algo.

On the surface, the 5-of-10 algo seems to me like a halfway decent compromise, giving drivers up front details if they simply maintain a 50% acceptance rate. Of course drivers who accept a smaller percentage of rides will note that the low pay makes the 5-of-10 algo a joke. But even in my locale, where Uber still pays 98 cents a mile and 17 cents a minute, the 5-of-10 algo is a clown act. As anyone who has focused on the algo knows, acceptance rate is based upon each individual ride request, rather than on passenger request.

The downside of this nuanced difference played out for me yesterday with ""Darren"". Darren wanted a ride. Badly. His request for a long ride on the Lyft platform came to me, and I declined it. For my own good reasons I was unable to accommodate a pax who wanted a ride out of town. After all, I am an Independent Contractor and it is my right to choose which rides work for me. Darren then came in on the Uber app, which I also declined, lowering my 9 of 10 acceptance rate one notch. Undaunted, for the next half hour Darren toggled back and forth between platforms, requesting his out-of-town ride.

Uber, in all its wisdom, kept sending me Darren's requests. The algo was too dumb to realize that if I turned the request down once, nothing was going to change 5 minutes later. But the requests kept coming, and I noticed my acceptance rate was dropping with each successive decline. Finally, while on another ride, Darren's request came in again. Only this time there was no destination. I didn't realize the request was from stubborn Darren, and stupidly accepted it.

I drive the 10 minutes to the pickup point, then down a 1/4 mile dirt road, which cakes the back of my freshly washed car with dust, only to realize after starting the ride that my pax was the now infamous Darren. ""Darren, I'm so sorry. I can't drive you to xxx. I know there's not a lot of Uber cars on duty right now (being that a lot of drivers are still preferring UI) but I just can't do it"". Darren, whose family is just starting up a pot farm, replies in a most mellow way that it is totally cool, and to just drop him back to his pickup location. I do and move on.

Uber. Dude. I just want a reasonable driving experience. Anything less than that and you are de-incentivizing me. Get it?

You can sit around and wait for one of the promo rides, or, if you want to make money, you can take what comes your way and hopefully a few of the very short $10 rides will come your way as well. Yesterday I took a 20 minute pick up at our airport for a 20 minute ride. Normally and especially during these promotions I get in touch with the rider and make sure that he is coming back towards the downtown area. 90% of the time that would be the case; if they say they're going North or West towards Harrisonburg I would probably cancel. I don't want to end up 45 minutes away from the downtown area and possibly deadhead all the way back. In this case I got no answer on my text, and assuming that the guy was probably waiting for his bag or just on the phone I went ahead to the pick up anyway. Surprise! Going north to Ruckersville. S.hit!! Oh well. Took him home, $22 ride and $5 tip, OK. Set destination back to downtown and luckily got two trips along the return, one short and one all the way back downtown. Both of these tipped, feeling lucky and good at this point. Then I got the phone call. My airport passenger thinks he left his phone in my car. I look around the back and there it is under the seat on the side where he dropped it. (His girlfriend is smoking hot, and not shy by the way. Kids, this is why you should lock your phones.) So I made the honest and well intentioned mistake of telling him that I found it. This nice guy with the hot girlfriend immediately turned into an entitled jerk and demanded that I return ""my property!"" to him at his house, which is now more than 45 minutes away from my location. At this point I had already accepted another trip so I told him to call me back in half an hour. A few minutes later I got in touch with support and they confirmed to me that since I had informed the passenger and Uber that I found his property, I was now obligated to return it to him. Good Lord, what a freaking nightmare. Surge popping up on top of the promotion in the downtown area, it's heating up as people are starting to return to their hotels and homes from going out to eat, I'm going to miss making some really good money if I drive all the way out to this dude's house again. He calls me again for the 4th time. He is getting upset and is very pushy, continues to demand that I drive to his home and return his property. I push my luck and fib; tell him that I cannot possibly drive all the way to Ruckersville as ""I'm at the end of my shift."" After a near meltdown he acquiesces and agrees to meet me half way. I suggest Walmart and he finally agrees. Walmart is fortunately much farther for him than for me, so I came out OK on this. Drove to Walmart did a little shopping, met the guy in front, returned his phone and he didn't say a word; no ""thank you!"" nothing. What a jerk, and lesson learned; never again will I admit to finding a phone from a distant drop off and never again will I drop anyone off at a distance without thoroughly checking around the back seat. After over 5,000 trips I know better, this was a stupid mistake. But I got my $15 returned item fee, and after another long talk with support they also added a bonus $6 promotion to my account.",2021

The funny part was she put the wrong address in. Then she asked me to grab my phone. I said, ""okay, but I don't have the cash app."" Hahaha because she was probably trying to send herself money.

post-7123436,Haanjo,"Jun 28, 2021 at 12:10 AM","I picked up an Uber Eats order from a discount restaurant.

As I'm about to arrive at the customers apartment, a phone call comes in. I figure it's the customer who wants to give me special instructions to get to their place, so I answer.

Turns out it's the restaurant manager. He said he was not watching the front desk, and his employee forgot to give me the drinks that went with the order.

I tell him to refund the drinks, and I'm not coming back because I don't get paid to go back and deliver the drinks, and besides, it's his employee's responsibility to give me the correct order.

He tells me its between the customer and Uber, and its my responsibility to get the order right too. I tell him not only was his employee rude, but not to blame me for his employees mistake.

He tells me to tell the customer that I forgot his drinks. I tell him I'm done talking to him, to have a good night, and hang up the phone. At this point, I'm pretty irritated, and basically had already raised my voice when he blamed me for the mistake.

Yeah, I know, I could have checked for drinks, but when an employee hands me an order, I'm going to assume its correct. Every once in a while I do check orders for drinks, and occassionally I do catch errors, but I'm not going to waste my time and check the accuracy of orders everytime, especially if 97% of the time the orders are correct anyway, which is my satisfaction rate after this order.

What I didn't realize until I hung up, is that the restaurant can actually give you negative feedback, and when I checked my rating for deliveries, sure enough, the manager dinged me. Apparently the customer dinged me too...about 5 minutes after I checked my rating from the merchant, my customer satisfaction rating had dropped from 98% to 97%...which I suspect happened when the customer called the restaurant and the manager blamed me for the mistake.

Anyway, I came really close for telling the manager to F*** Off, so I'm glad I kept my cool. 

So, if you ever find yourself of the situation, first off, don't be an idiot like me and answer your phone like I did, and if you do answer the phone, be careful what you say to the store manager. Having said that, you aren't a store employee, and if they try to blame you for their employee screwing up, tell them to shove it, because at the end of the day, it's on them and not you.",2021

post-7108895,Haanjo,"Jun 13, 2021 at 3:15 AM","Dear Ridershare Passengers,

When I'm waiting for you, I will wait 5 minutes. Not 5 minutes and one second. 5 minutes is 5 minutes. I only get paid roughly 12.5 cents per minute of wait time, and while I'm waiting for you, I'm missing out on other rides. 

And don't say you will tip me extra because often people who say that don't tip at all. For the record, sometimes I get paid more for cancelling the ride than I do for the ride itself, and keep in mind, I'm often parked in an odd spot waiting for you, sometimes blocking traffic, and sometimes dealing with drunk idiots who are trying to steal your ride.

And for the record, I understand that sometimes you need to pay your tab at the bar before you can leave. I get that. But you had a 15 minute notice for me to get there, while I was finishing up my last ride, plus another 5 minute notice while I was on my way to pick you up after dropping off my last passenger.

So, there is no excuse to not be waiting at the curb when I pull up. And for the record, when I started doing rideshare three and a half years ago, I used to bend over backwards for my passengers like you. But often, five minutes would turn into ten minutes, and when I bent over backwards for my passengers the most, you would be a bad passenger, things would go terribly wrong on the ride, and you would give me a one star rating for my efforts.

Over 11,000 rides later, I've learned from riders like you. 

When you say stuff like,

""Be right there"",

What you really mean is that you are going to be late. And if I've been patient enough to wait for you for the entire 5 minutes and beyond, no, you can't smoke a cigarette before we leave...get in the freaking car!

So there you have it. I'd like to be a nice guy and wait, but you need to show some courtesy and respect for your driver, and not sit there and socialize with your friend up until the last possible second, because once I hit the gas pedal and start to take off, it's too late, and yelling at me to come back isn't going to change things.

And for the record, it took something like 8,000 rides with 800 late passengers to develop this attitude.  Bottom line is I'm not messing around anymore. So be ready!

Love, 

Your Driver............Vrrrooooooom!",2021

Many of us have had pax tell us that other drivers let them do stuff we didn't, like fitting 5 pax in a small car and the like.

What are some of the most common or best ones you've heard?",2021
post-7067574,#1husler,"May 6, 2021 at 3:24 AM","Pax have been holding court, talking smack and spilling the tea (so to say) about all the kinds of drivers they really don't like, and why they give one stars and complaints. 

Here are some most common categories pax seem to talk about:

1. The odd-ball. Sure, it goes without saying that RS would attract its share of society's outliers (ie, those who need to pay the bills but can't manage a W-2 gig), but some seem to take it one step beyond, to the point of turning off, or even freaking out pax. Stand out examples, according to pax, include one guy who had a pit bull riding shotgun (service dog? who knows???), a woman who kept addressing a male pax as ""Martha"" (even after he corrected her) and another lady who had the inside of her car decked out with pulsing disco lights. 

2. The maniac on the streets. Its one thing to drive like a ""bat out of hell"" to hustle to the drop off ASAP, but completely another to almost cause multiple accidents, get into an unsparring amount of altercations (both verbal and physical) with other drivers on the road until pax pleads to end the ride early and be let off at the nearest corner. Not good for ""The Community""!

3. The slob. No pax likes getting into stranger's car which looks (and smells) like a junk yard. Even if their own car is that way or worse, they won't tolerate it when ""Ubering"" or ""Lyfting""... pax complain the some drivers car get super gross, and they have roll the windows because of the funky odor....drivers grouse about pax eating in their cars, but a number of drivers (as reported by pax) are the one's munching away, with a sandwich and/or burrito in hand, while driving, food slipping everywhere. Clearly a one star ride there. 

4. The anti-social introvert. Many of us (yours truly included) remain open to talking shop with a pax, about this and that, to establish rapport to pull down a tip. So it's surprising how many drivers don't work that tip, and instead simply unlock the door, set the GPS and drive in total silence, arrive, unlock door, done...no greeting and welcome, confirmation of name and destination, ""how's it going?"" etc, nothing. And I'm not talking about members of the Deaf Community who are driving...I mean the folks who take the whole ""our job is just to just to drive pax from point A to point B"" ethos a bit too literally. One pax recounted how they get into the car, told her driver ""good morning"" and received a grunt as a response, followed by glowering stare through the mirror. She canceled the ride (I might have too). 

Do any of you fill into these groups?

Or?

Can anyone add to this list?",2021
post-7110055,June132017,"Jun 14, 2021 at 2:27 PM","Reflecting back on 4 years into the game, but is it? I took massive time off in 2020 due to the pandemic. Ride share requests had dropped dramatically in late March 2020. 

I would say the respect from my friends went way down since i've become a rideshare driver. I would say overall my happiness went way up though.

Moneywise I'd say this gig isn't worth it. I think we pay too much fixing our cars and putting gas into them. My previous job didn't pay that much though. So it's not like I left a $100K job for this, or something. Also, you don't get alot of time off doing rideshare. People don't respect rideshare drivers and we put alot of work into it. Honestly I can't say I blame them after taking a few rides from other drivers. 

Running into people I used to know was a pretty big highlight for me. I helped a friend go 90 miles down the road the one day. I guess not a friend, but someone who went to elementary school with me. It was weird he was literally 80 miles from the school we went to. Then months later, I ran into someone else I knew and we decided to have dinner.

They realize what I'm doing, get out, he continues the rant and it now progresses into threats. I get in, drive across the street, tell dispatch the threat is over and no need to respond. then I call the Uber safety line and tell them what happened. 

About an hour later, I get an email.

""A rider recently claimed that you declined their trip based on the destination provided. We wanted to let you know about this report because refusing a trip based on destination goes against the  as well as local regulations in many areas, and could result in loss of access to the Driver app.""

I responded with a detailed account of what happened and received an email in return basically said everything was OK.

So obviously the safety line does not share information with whatever department handles complaints.",2021

Got a ping and rolled up to pick up a lady that was crippled by cerebral palsy sitting on a bench in the hot sun. Helped her in the car and started the ride. Two blocks down the road to a lawyer's office to drop off a form! She said she didn't know how to add a stop so I showed her on the app and she said she needed to go home- 1 1/2 hours away in afternoon ATL traffic. She was very tired and I knew she wouldn't get a ride any time soon at that time of day, so I said add a good tip and I would do it. She agreed and off we went together, her talking non stop all the way. I even stopped and bought her a water. I helped her to her door and turned around for an hour dead leg back to ATL. 
Yep, no tip. I feel like I got played. I think this has been used before with other drivers...SO NO MATTER WHAT, END THE RIDE FIRST!

A couple of minutes into the ride he appeared to be getting agitated, sighing etc. I did have to go backwards a little bit before heading towards the destination, because of the nature of the several lane road etc., but nothing too out of the ordinary. 

About halfway through the ride he asked if he could roll down the window. I said sure, no problem, and I cracked mine as well to avoid the reverb. I asked him if it was too hot and he said no (my A/C was set to an appropriate level).

I don't think he was concerned about COVID because he wasn't wearing a mask until right before he got into my car. I did have an almost full cup of very strong coffee, but I've never gotten a complaint about that and even regular compliments on the aroma.

I dropped him off at his destination and then it dawned on me: the egg salad sandwich I had purchased at a convenience store and placed on the passenger seat was giving off an aroma. If he had smelled it through the coffee aroma, he probably thought I was a gassy driver. I moved the sandwich to the hatchback before picking up my next pax.

Waiting for a bad rating or even a complaint, but I hope to avoid it. He was a 4.98, like me, so hopefully he gives me the benefit of the doubt.

Next time I think I will skip the egg salad sandwich.",2021

post-7063411,Haanjo,"May 2, 2021 at 1:44 PM","Actually, it was more like 35 seconds...

Last night I had a Lyft pickup at a pool (billiards) bar at around 12:30 am.

After about a minute and a half of waiting, a guy comes out and says, ""Wow, you were fast"", not realizing he had been in my que for close to 25 minutes, and was less than 2 miles from my last drop off. He then goes back into the bar.

At around the 4 minute mark, he comes back out and says he is waiting for his friend, and proudly says he will make it worth my while if I wait. I simply respond with the universal ""ok, ok"". At that point I explain to him that he has about 30 seconds...and he runs into the bar to get his friend.

The clock ticks down to zero, and he still hasn't shown up, so naturally I bolt. With around 11,000 Uber and Lyft rides to date, I no longer mess around. I'm serious when I say you have 30 seconds...

As I take off, I hear him yell, ""That wasn't 30 seconds, sir"", but the reality is that it was closer to 35 seconds...or more accurately 5 minutes and five seconds or so.

I don't get why so many people take so long to get ready. In my case, whenever I book Lyft ride, I'm ready before the driver gets to my pickup location. In this case, I get that my rider was probably finishing up a game of pool, but at this stage of the game, I don't put up with the BS I put up with when I was a new driver, and I won't hesitate to leave you behind if you are not ready, or if you chose to socialize with your friends for even 3 minutes...I will not hesitate to leave you behind if you don't give me the same respect as I given other Lyft drivers when they pick me up.

This video shows the entire ride, start to finish. I sped up the parts with no dialogue. Here's a summary:

0:00-0:34 - greeting and confirmation of destination. Pax has an obvious bad attitude from the start.
1:59-2:15 - Pax sends me a text through app: ""I don't like your music, [name]"". I ask her ""You don't like my music? You want me to turn it off?"" to which she remains silent. I switch off the radio. At this point I start to worry about this pax. This was the most bizarre thing to happen during my 2000~ rides.
3:25-end - I ask the pax, ""So, now I'm curious, what kind of music do you like to listen to?"" to which she responds ""I don't have any interest in speaking with you."" That's when I pulled over to cancel the ride. That's when the fireworks happen.

Notes: 1) I have a big, obvious wedding band on my ring finger, I don't flirt with pax, and this one wasn't even attractive. 2) We had listened to Beatles' ""Here Comes The Sun"", but apparently she really didn't like listening to Pink Martini's rendition of ""Bolero"". 3) I am starting a new job very soon, so my tolerance for pax bullshit is at an all-time low. None of them ever get to treat me like The Help in my own car ever again. Deactivation from a false accusation from her, or from posting this video online? I don't care.

Weekend started off bad with my 3rd trip being and Uber Scammer. I'll post more about that in Uber Eats.

Had more cancels this past weekend than I have had so far this year.

First cancel, Friday Night, this guy was way to drunk to be getting in my car. Here is a series of screen shots from my dash cam. Easy pass, he actually fell again when he got past my front bumper giving me room to drive off. Luckily he fell away from my car.

Two more cancels Friday night where PAX texted me just before the 5 minutes was up that they were on the way. I was not in the mood to pick up people that made me wait. Waited out timer and drove off with cancel fee. Ended up calling it a night out of frustration and headed home.

Saturday started out okay. Friday's Uber Eats episode still lingering I opted not to turn eats on the rest of the weekend. Soon the cancels started rolling in. 6 for the day, 3 PAX cancelled as I arrived at pick-up point, 2 I cancelled for No Show. The final cancel was this little peach. Hard to see her in the picture, boy friend is leaning over her as she is puking out her guts. Good Bye, let someone else deal with that.




Last trip Saturday night, pick-up at a wedding property and take a couple to their resort. They were discussing that they need to leave at 8:00 AM to get to the airport on time. Non eventful 3 mile trip. I head toward my next pick-up and see flashing lights in my mirror for a brief second. Than nothing. Get to my pick-up and the guy gets in and says hey someone left their phone. Damn, bet that was the flashing light I saw. Drop them off pretty close to resort I dropped last couple off at. Select found item option and previous trip. Used call PAX option and sure enough it was his phone as it started ringing. Went by their cottage at the resort and knocked on door. No answer. Oh well, left a note on their door to contact Uber. Turned phone off and put it in an electronics bag so they could not track it to my house.

Get up early Sunday looking for an airport trip or two. Get a ping that just looks funny, no addresses that I recognize. I accept and start to get ready to walk out the door. I get a text message saying please call me. I call PAX and he tells me where he is at. He wants me to come pick him up some 40 miles away an take him to Aventura some 120 miles away. He proceeds to tell me the app keeps telling him no drivers available where he is at so he kept randomly putting in trips. I tell him I can't drive 40 miles un paid for a trip that will take me 80 miles from where I live. He says tell me what address to put in that is close to where I am at and he will put in a multi stop trip to come get him, take him to Aventura and he will take care of my return miles. A couple of minutes later I get pick-up updated so I continue out the door. Trip started 1 minute from my house, to 40 miles south for first stop.

I was passing the resort from PAX that left phone in my car so I stopped and knocked on door again. I also had already turned the phone back on to see if they would try and call it. My note was still there, and I knew they were planning on leaving in about an hour and I would be on a long trip and not able to return the phone. No answer. Oh well, off I go to pick-up my PAX. About 10 minutes away from my pick-up the left phone rings. I answer it and pretty much tell the guy he is out of luck as I was on a long trip. Told him I would ask my PAX I was picking up if they minded if I stopped to drop the phone off. Told him to call back in 15 minutes.

Get to the stop and a guy comes out and says he needs a few minutes and says thanks for going out of your way and slips me some cash. I ask him if he was okay with me dropping of the phone, he was sure that is fine. I look at the cash he hands me, a very, very, generous tip. As I'm waiting at his Ocean front house I notice the multiple high end cars, couple of antique jeeps, 2 sizeable boats, 6 wave runners, and two crotch rockets. Man this guy is not hurting for cash at all. A few minutes later he comes out with a piece of eye candy in a tight little dress. Some back and forth conversation and he gives her an envelope. Does not take long to figure out he is a pay to play type guy. Lady gets in my car and has a very quite voice with a unique accent. He is staying, she is going with me, he thanks me again. She makes a phone call and I realize she is speaking Russian. Next thing I know she is laying down in my back seat.

Other guys phone rings, and I arrange for him to be standing on the side of the road so I can just pull over and hand him the phone. 30 minutes later I get to point he is standing there and I hand him the phone and he hands me $60. He looks at my PAX in the back seat, gets a shocked look and then laughs. I look back and her dress has rode up and her ass is just hanging out. Yep, you guessed it, no panties. She is sound a sleep.

Here is a not so revealing picture after she rolled over and kind of fixed herself. Ended up dropping her off outside Trump International Beach Resort where her ,I'm guessing, pimp was standing outside a Cadillac Escalade waiting for her.

I told her that was too much. I assumed she wasn't aware of the currency and exactly how much she was giving me, so I refused.
I then deduced based on some hand gestures toward the app that she thought she had to pay for the ride.

Both these ride were fine with me...because this PUs were each only like 3 mins away from me and I was chasing down promos on them (I knocked out these rides in under 5 mins total)....but aside from that it seems a waste during an ""Uber shortage"" to take lazy pax 3 blocks down the road to get a beer while others need to go to the airport, etc., and are getting a ""no car available"" response...I'm wondering if Uber would hike minimum fares (AND share it with drivers) during this so-called ""driver shortage"" to better utilize drivers.",2021

post-7066706,The Gift of Fish,"May 5, 2021 at 11:37 AM","Time for another What Would You Do poll. It was Tuesday night and business was very slow in SF when I got a ping from the airport, 9 miles away from my location. Uber was offering $55 for a 49 mile ride east. 100 miles total and around 2 hours, and gas for the trip would cost around 9 bucks, so $23 revenue per hour after gas. Way below target earnings, but it would be an easy freeway ride and the city was as quiet as underwater flatulence, so I accepted.

Then the message came in from the pax:







Pax tells me she is at the terminal. I tell pax that I cannot pick up from the terminals. Pax replies that she will go to a different terminal. 'Cause if the driver says that he can't pick up from the terminals, only from the designated pickup area, it does of course make sense to suggest a different terminal to be picked up from. Because who knows where the pickup area is. Shoot me now.

By this point the pax had confirmed herself as a fully-fledged moron. Your choices as a driver are:

1) Try to give pax step-by-step instructions on how to find the pickup area. (a) Look for the signs, (b) walk in direction indicated by signs, (c) stop walking when pickup area is reached. The moron is strong in this pax; chance of success: 10%

2) Do an illegal pickup at the terminal where the pax is. Chance of success: 80%. Chance of $100 ticket from airport cops: 20-40%.

3) Drive to pickup area, wait 5:00 and then no show pax. Drive to airport was 9 miles; no show fee will be around 9 bucks. Chance of success: 100%

Went to a pickup at a restaurant, a large group of girls, four came to my car, I patiently explained the rule of 3. Some mild arguing ensued but they were mostly polite, after a quick huddle 3 of them hopped in for the short ride back to their sorority. There was some furtive whispering going on but this happens a lot, they are barely old enough to drink (or have fake id's) after all, so I ignored it. Dropped off, exaggerated ""thank you!"" from the girls, off they skipped. No, really; one of them actually skipped! 

I turned around left the parking lot got 3 blocks away: ""ping!"" Pickup location is.... the place I just left. Different requestor. 
U-turn, back to the parking lot and....canceled by rider within one minute. I turn around and again get just a couple blocks away; ping! Same thing again, different name.

post-7067035,MyJessicaLS430,"May 5, 2021 at 5:07 PM","Yesterday afternoon, I drove back home during lunch break. Ahead of me was a brand new ES with a temporary plate whose driver was waiting for somebody to open the building main gate. Obviously the driver doesn't live here as he walked toward me and signalled that he was picking up somebody. He is an older gentleman in the late 50s and politely asked if I could buzz him in. Sure. I needed to get inside too 🤣 . 

The first thing I realized is his hat that reads US Marine. Out of curiosity, I asked whether he was still actively serving (may be a position of command, intelligence or training the newly recruits, etc). By the time I entered the passcode, he said he no longer served and was no different than any other citizen. Then I thought we would part our ways after a simply reply with ""Oh, I see"". When I was about to leave, the same car was still parking by the garage gate with hazard lights on. I then offered to open the garage gate beside the main gate such that he could wait inside the building. He said ""That is sweet of you but I don't know which floor my  lives"".

Wait a second, did he say ? ""Sorry, by any chance are you driving Uber or Lyft?"", I asked. Later, he told me that it was the second week doing rideshare as a means of distraction from the pain of losing his daughter to TNBC (triple negative breast cancer). ""I am so sorry for the loss, I know how hard it is to accept the reality of tested negative for all the receptors"". Before I answered his question about my background, I thought it was far more important for him to learn how not to be taken advantage of. ""Sir, I know this is not my business but I think you should shuffle and move on. It has already been almost 15 minutes since we first met. You should have cancelled the ride"". Personally I despise any behaviours that abuses the older generations. Unlike the cunning, deceitful and entitled youth, the elder adults are honest and hard-working humans. They don't deserve to be treated like this. 

After leaving him confused, I disclose that I am a former driver. This just gets to my nerves how his kindness is abused. I left him my contact if he wanted a rideshare 101. Yes, that may sound ignorant to be rideshare mentor as I am nowhere close to how experienced most are on this forum but again, he deserves better than this. At this paltry rate, these low-lives do not deserve a brand new vehicle, not to mention a Lexus. ""Allow me to be blunt but you are not going to make money. You are basically giving people free rides"". Although I realize that this is just an activity to keep him occupied, it doesn't make any financial sense in any part.",2021

And I always want to ask: Why do you do this? By now, everyone should realize that Uber is not a great full-time job - if it ever was. By now, you can't exactly blame Uber for your particular situation. You've had plenty of time to re-evaluate and get out if that's what you want. And so, again I wonder: Why keep doing something you so obviously dislike?

Middle-aged couple got in the car at a hotel the other morning. Black couple but I don't think it matters. Woman asks me to pop the truck, so I do and then I hop out and help them load their numerous bags. As we leave for the short ride to the airport, I ask them about their stay and such. Just idle chit-chat. When we get to the airport, I hop out and go get one of the little baggage carts they provide. This ain't New York, it's pretty chill here and I didn't have another ride stacked.

""You're the best Uber driver ever!"" the old guy goes. Which I know is not true, but he meant it sincerely. ""Our last two drivers ignored us...wouldn't help with the bags, didn't talk to us...made us feel like we were imposing on him."" I thanked them and wished them a pleasant trip home. By the time I was out of the airport, I saw the $10 tip on top of the $5.71 fare.

Look, this job really isn't that hard or that bad. Just be nice to people...treat them like human beings, not some big inconvenience or annoyance. If you don't like people, perhaps ride-sharing is not the field for you. If you're not making enough money doing ride-share, perhaps it's not the field for you. And if you resent passengers for not living up to your expectations at the beginning, middle or end of the ride, perhaps ride-share is not the field for you.

Me, I happen to love this job! Every day, I thank God that Uber came along and got me out of driving a taxi (which was okay but a lot more work for the money). I've had a lot of fun jobs...but mainly I've been a helicopter pilot most of my life, and doing  job is the most fun I've ever had. No, I'm not getting rich, and I'm putting about 30,000/year on the car, which is fine. Uber/Lyft gives me about $2,400 - $2,500 per month in my bank account. I could make more if I wanted to work harder, but I don't.

Some of you guys really need an attitude check. The passengers are not your enemy. I wish some drivers would stop treating them as though they are. It makes it hard for the rest of us.

I myself was assaulted by a young college student drunk girl. I dropped her boyfriend off anf they were repeat customers of mine and they always got matched up with me when I was nearby. All of a sudden as we were driving at night in the rich Edina homes area, she grabs me from behind my seat and she isn't aware she is choking me and I can't even talk while at same time she pressed her face with smelly melted makeup hard against my cheek as she says ""I hope you get mad p**** tonight"" and i tried removing her arm off my adams apple as she was constricting my airflow and me blacking out means we will end up crashing into some million dollar home.

The fight or flight adrenaline rush kicked in and I had to go SSJ2 with more blood flow to my muscles just to get her large arm off of me. I thought to myself is this German genetics or were womem always this strong?.

I spared her of calling police on her as I didn't wanna ruin her future with a criminal record because she was drunk and didn't know she was endangering myself and herself and stuff outside the car in event of accident. I warned her but with her drunkenness, she didn't even listen to me. 

In another incident an upscale looking man with golf shirt tucked in and looking like a father of your average college students. When we got on the freeway he asks me if I am sending the drug dealers to assassinate him. I offered to kick him out but he apologized so I dropped him off anyways. He was maybe methhead.

In another case in an upscale condo ping, I picked up an Engineer who looked like a young Robert Redford, and we had a couple stops 1 being the gas station and other being his girlfriend house.

When we got to his girlfriend house and parked right in front of it on street where she can even see us if so she checked her large house windows, I noticed the guy wasn't getting out then after a while he asks me ""Can I ask you something (fill in my name here)"" then I replied ""man it doesn't sound good if you have to ask me if it's ok if you wanna ask me something"".

Then he says, ""Can I suck your D quick""? Where D is you know what. I then replied ""your girlfriend house is right there and can see us"" then he asks again and I reply can you just go to your girlfriend? Then he asks again and I start opening my door and he gets scared and exists finally. 

All these incidents are just with 4k rides I had. There are tons of drivers with 20k rides. Imagine what they have seen and experienced. 

When I come back to Uber driving I will so get custom aftermarket bp glass shielding around my car seat separating me from front and rear sitting Pax. No law against it. Plus shootings happen in twin cities where I drove.

It's a crazy workd out there. You guy remember what that Walmart girl did to that Uber driver when she slashed him up to death.

Back to that girl who choked me, in the days following her assault, I noticed increased fat burning and more muscle definition on myself and thought to myself ""I think the body thinks theres danger nearby always now that I survived that incident and body is favouring fitness now for survival lol""",2021
post-7055056,rich5371,"Apr 25, 2021 at 7:19 PM","Last night I picked up a passenger from a Hospital Emergency Room entrance; he was escorted out by a big burly sheriff's deputy and two hospital orderlies (big men). The passenger was behaving a bit odd from the start and I didn't feel good about taking him, but I didn't feel like I could ask him to get out of the car at that point. Big lesson learned.
His destination was 9 miles away, and he was bouncing off the sides of the vehicle the whole way, throwing trash out the window, sounding like he was gagging and possibly spitting, I just held my breadth and told myself we would be at the destination and it would be over soon. We got to the destination and he was laying down on the floor across the passenger and driver area, and he would not get out of the car. After nearly 10 minutes I had no choice but to call 911. He started spitting at things all over the car, bringing up mucus and real nasty spit. After 20 minutes of waiting, he started to make like a tent in the back seat with his shirt, and I'd had enough. I opened up the back door again and told him that was it, he had to get out of my vehicle. He lunged up between the seats into the front, grabbed my bag of personal items and my cell phone and tried to get away. I body slammed him back and he dropped the phone and bag. He was pushed back into the car in that exchange, and I put my head in and convinced him if he didn't get out it would be bad for him. He opened the passenger side door, got out and walked away. As soon as he was no longer in site the Sheriff deputy showed up. I told the deputy what happened and the direction the guy left in. The glass back of my Samsung S9+ was shattered, the deputy asked if I wanted to file a report on it and I said no, not right then. Maybe later. I reached out to Uber and escalated the situation to a supervisor. They are ""glad I'm not hurt"", won't do anything about the spit (no pictures, I wiped the nastiness up with a towell), and offered me $15.00 for my destroyed phone. I sent pictures of the phone along with the receipt. I buy phones outright, it was $550.00. I can't press charges because I can't get the passengers information. I can only imagine one of my adult daughters being put in this situation.

A rather young guy, in his mid 20s, coming from a friend's house. He told me that he lost his car and license in Illinois because of unpaid Illinois Tollway fines! When I asked him how much he owed, his answer shocked me. The pax said he owed over $12,000! I thought he meant $1200. But he said he just kept on ignoring the fines until the fines multiplied...all the while running even more tolls and having them multiply. I am not sure how the fines multiply, but I am guessing it was not a simple ""doubling"" like overdue parking tickets. He did say that he was optimistic that he could under the new Illinois law regarding tollway fines to have them significantly reduced under some pandemic assistance relief program.

Interestingly for me, she just dropped out of law school to pursue her dreams of being an Instagram star. She told me that she is buying books and researching the topic aggressively. I showed her some of my magic tricks at the end of the Uber ride, and she encouraged me to build a social media account. I just perused some of her Instagram pics. Perhaps she has what it takes. She told me that she hated law school and found it to be super dry, boring, and tedious. I picked her up from a bar around Mount Prospect, IL.

I found it fascinating because as I wrote there seems to be a definite trend, how many young people are seeking to build a career in the world of social media. They are shunning traditional careers and trying hard to carve their own path. Many guys are trying to sell merchandise online, and produce music. Many young ladies are trying to make it in the world of fashion and cooking. She says she is actively advertising her Instagram account and trying to build up a large following. A whole bunch of them are doing loads and loads of TikTok videos. Here are a few of her pics. I can certainly tell from the efforts she has been putting into her pictures and her many many posts that she is dead serious.

I've even had pax going out on the town and even a few tourists, unheard of since the beginning of the pandemic. More importantly, in the two weeks that I've been back to pax, a handful are actually tipping! 😂 

But, here's the downside. I've had ridiculously long distances to pick up pax, loads of ""scheduled"" trips, and TONS of dead miles / tolls. 118+ miles for about $85 has been the norm. 

Every day since I fired up X, it has been the same - start the trip, immediately bombarded with pings. Most are crap. I have to sign in again at least six times a day after getting the boot. Why? Because nobody is out driving! 

I fired up the Uber pax app yesterday, the only ants were hopelessly sitting at the airport. 

I want to see more ants. I want to make the same amount without driving way more miles than I did before. 

Nine trips on Uber left for a $120 quest left for tomorrow, then $100 for ten trips on Lyft Saturday. The money is out there.",2021

post-7049839,The Gift of Fish,"Apr 21, 2021 at 7:40 PM","Last night I took a pax on a short ride of a few miles. Upon checking the back seat after he got out, I noticed that there was a liquid stain in the seat about 8 by 4 inches. There was no indication of what the liquid was. 

I got my phone out, took the pictures and then sent them in to Uber with the damage report. I then got the gloves and paper towels out and blotted and dried the stain as much as possible. A few hours later the stain had almost gone, just leaving a faint outline ring. At the end of the night I did the usual routine of Lysol and water cleaning of the seat (have to clean the entire seat base to not leave water stains). It took about 10 minutes to clean.

Anyway, I though that Uber would give me 20 bucks. The next morning they emailed me to tell me that they had charged the pax $150. In contrast to Uber's lowball cleaning fees of late (I recently got just 40 bucks for puke on the car), $150 was too much for this stain.

post-7050023,Benjamin M,"Apr 21, 2021 at 9:10 PM","Already depressed, stressed out, and getting fatigued running all over the place for awful pings (ENDLESS after starting a trip), I accepted a ping 16 minutes away back downtown from far south in a bad area. At least it would get me back to the city. The ping only said ""premium pickup possible"" with a $2 surge.

Driving there, I saw that it was a hospital pick up for a patient. These have been prevalent lately, especially at JenCare Senior Clinics. I did not think much of it, usually they're fairly short, but a tip is out of the question because they're booked by a third party. 

I pull up, patient is wheeled to my car, and belongings are put in the trunk. Then I slide ""start"". 

198 mile trip. Already hungry and tired, EZ Pass running low, and no compensation for 190+ miles to get home. 

I turn to the door to hopefully grab the staff, they vanished into thin air. Called from the app, went to the patient. 

Apologized to him profusely and escorted him to a bench in front of the door. I tried to explain that he would need to tell the hospital that he needed another car and to let the driver know in advance that it was an extremely long trip. He did not seem to understand that, but did understand why I had to cancel. 

Medical staff and patients often seems to think that all we do is medical transport if we pick up at a hospital or clinic. They do not understand that we're Joe Regular Uber Driver. 

And it's very frustrating, especially after years of doing actual medical transport - including trips such as this, but being paid almost $30/hr regardless of dead miles, driving a vehicle that doesn't belong to me, and not paying for fuel or tolls.

But as the taxi industry in my city evaporated, one of my major critics wisely decided to switch over too. He turned in his leased cab, bought a little Chevy four-door, and signed up with Lyft (but  Uber for some reason).

He did Lyft for a couple of weeks - enjoyed the money-in versus expenses-out. This past Monday, I texted him and asked how his weekend went? ""Great!"" he said. ""I made $315 on Saturday and Sunday."" I thought that was pretty good, because Saturday was so rainy that I didn't even drive. Then he added, ""But I made all of that delivering food. I don't even do Lyft anymore. Too much driving!""

And there you have it. Uber and Lyft could not have predicted the rise in food-delivery services, and the need for them during this pandemic (which will continue). Bottom Line: Food delivery drivers make more money with less miles driven. They stay local, and don't go on any long trips like I did today:  trips over to Alabama with a deadhead back because I cannot take Uber  Lyft trips trips in Alabama.

I strongly suspect that more and more R/S drivers are switching to food for the same reason(s) as my friend. And so I am not surprised that Uber and Lyft have gotten super-busy here in my town, where it used to be pretty slow. Me? I'll stick with passengers.

I went from somewhere around a 4.94 rating (that began to fall before the shit really hit the fan, low quality pax) 90%+ AR, and Diamond status, to - 58% AR, 7% CR, and stuck at 4.88 (I'm sure I have been rated, however the numbers haven't budged).

I started X again when Eats had technical issues and customer tips fell sharply. At the same time, a driver buddy began doing X in the same market, brand spanking new.

While he's staying roughly in the same area (from my understanding), I'm getting TONS of ridiculous pings - awful ratings, long distance to pick up, and nothing remotely near the city (which has had consistant surges).

110 miles today, rounding up to four hours online (went offline for about 20 minutes hoping to get trips in the city), untold how many unpaid tolls, and I made $68.

The driver shortage is definitely a factor right now (see ""PLEASE DRIVE"") but it also appears that the algorithm is leaning towards brand new drivers like my buddy (well established on Eats, brand new to X) and giving me the bird.

It's so frustrating to have ENDLESS pings all day, every day, but the vast majority of them are not profitable. Combined with not having trip duration because there's no way I will hit 85% AR.

post-7021149,Young Kim,"Apr 11, 2021 at 4:06 PM","Had a pickup in downtown Chicago by the Hotel Intercontinental going to Scores Bar (a strip club), 30 minutes westbound. The pax asked if he could play DMX through my bluetooth. DMX is somewhat before the rappers I love like Wiz Khalifa, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, and Cardi B....but... when we listened to it, I was happily surprised by his gritty style, very ""real"" lyrics. The next ride from Scores brought me to the west side of Chicago and then the south side.

So I listened to him all night, and as I mentioned, once you get to the west or south side of Chicago, you don't often leave the area. This is because many drivers will avoid the area or log off once they drop off there. Therefore, if you get to the area and leave on the app, you will stay there all night. Many pax who came in were so excited and happy that an Asian would enjoy hip hop/ rap/ R&B, and congratulated me on my musical tastes.

I spoke to pax all night regarding DMX, his turbulent life, and his very depressing death. One young lady pax I spoke to said that DMX reminded her of her family a great deal... a very high functioning drug user. She talked about how her father uses PCP casually and does a good job to help the community and other people. She said that drug users should not be stereotyped as criminals. The young lady emphasized that once you demonize drugs and make it illegal, it glamorizes it and makes rebellious young people get into it more and more.

Pax talked about how music unifies and brings the world together, and DMX the rapper made incredible music. One pax kept using the word, GOAT, as an acronym to describe DMX (G=Greatest, O=Of, A=All, T=Time). It was amazing to see the impact that the death of a legendary rapper had on a community like Chicago. After my shift, I watched some of DMX's acting jobs with Jet Li... like in Cradle2Grave and Romeo Must Die. He was a very talented person!

post-7006439,Seamus,"Apr 7, 2021 at 10:18 AM","Like many, I started Ubering and was as naive as could be. Uber just became legal in NY (outside NYC) in July of 2017 and because it was brand new both pax and drivers were trying to figure it all out.

Shortly after starting to Uber I started lurking in the UP forum for awhile before joining. It was somewhat of a different forum back then, more like a band of pirates giving tips on how to make more money and strategizing to beat Uber. Back then, Uber's AI was no where near as good as it is today and a driver had a much easier time manipulating the ""system"" to maximize revenue. Now forget it, Uber's AI is too good to beat except in rare circumstances.

I started reading in UP about longhauling, Shirlington Shuffling (deliberately not intending to give a ride) and creating surges. (Yes, believe it or not you used to be able to create surges)! I thought I would never do any of that in a million years. After dealing with Uber and pax BS, boy did that change! In the interest of space I'll just choose one (although I've done them all)



I thought it was terrible that a driver would deliberately boost up a fare, then I met ""Karen"". I took ""Karen"" on a 1.5x surge to JFK Airport in NYC from the northern suburbs. At a 1.5x surge with higher rates that was a very decent fare. Karen immediately became one of the most annoying pax I ever gave a ride to. She was a visitor to NY from Chicago and immediately started pounding and pounding what a terrible place NY was. Next, she found out that I was born in Scotland and spent the next 15 minutes telling me how bad Scotland was and that it was one of the ""worse places on the face of the earth"". She was crass, obnoxious, and extremely rude! The final straw was her telling me how ""blatantly stupid"" most Uber drivers were. That was it. OK Karen, we are going to JFK by way of Long Island!!! :roflmao:. If you look at my route it looked like a very pregnant line. FU Karen!

post-7020811,Young Kim,"Apr 11, 2021 at 1:53 PM","Picked up a young lady pax south of downtown Chicago around 1:30 am, and heard her talking to a guy in a hushed voice on the phone, ""So you got what I need?, because I got the money..."" She talked price on the phone and then hung up. We then started talking, and she said she was going deeper into the south side of Chicago to ""complete a deal"". She clutched her large purse and counted cash. I thought for sure it was something else, but I found out that she had human hair wigs in her purse.

She said this when I asked her how she is managing the pandemic with all the uncertainty in employment for everyone (This is one of my standard pax questions). She said, like many young pax, that she was self-employed, and bought and sold hair weaves and wigs. She explained that all her products come straight from Asia. She said, ""It comes from your countries, China, Korea, and India."" 

She said that the best hair and prices come from the East. She buys them from a secret source and then resells them. This is why she feels the need to hide them from law enforcement. ""Human hair"" wigs are not by themselves illegal, but she felt that if law enforcement somehow discovered the source, she could get into trouble (sort of like having cartons of cigarettes which escaped duty/ U.S. Customs/ tax)

When I asked her if I could see one, she looked behind us and around first, said, ""Well, I don't see any police, so here is one"". She showed me a few, and some were weaves and some were wigs (which one was dyed blond and brown). They looked very nice and high quality to me. The pax described her business, which was booming.

She said that there are smugglers of vast amounts of human hair which are often obtained illegally. She said that in some Asian countries, ladies have their long hair cropped off against their will, sometimes in cases of religious sacrifice (like when a ""holy"" leader will tell the lady that to show her love and devotion to a god, then she must demonstrate a sacrifice...like her long hair. (Which the religious leader will then sell). 

I didn't really know this illegal, but I guess the young lady knew that she cannot be in possession of large quantities of it. This puzzled me, because I know many wigs are made with real human hair, and I had no idea this would be illegal. She really acted like she had bags of illicit substances in her purse, which was my first guess. I am guessing that while a person can have maybe one of two wigs for personal use, if someone has many many such hair pieces, then it may not be permitted if it was determined that such products were smuggled into the U.S.? 

I suppose I found this pax ride interesting, because she told me that up to 90% of young ladies on the south and west sides of Chicago have wigs and hair extensions! I thought that young ladies just straighten their hair and then carefully take hours to ""weave"" them or braid them by hand. But my pax explained that almost always you are looking at a wig, not their natural hair. 

Then she surprised me by pulling up her own beautiful weave to reveal... a nearly bald shaved head! She said her ethnicity's hair ""frizzes"" so easily, especially in moisture, so it is far easier to have very very short hair and then just put on a wig / weave. The pax explained that she makes a very good living buying, creating, styling, human hair from the Asian countries, and there is a massive never ending market at least here in Chicago.",2021
post-6939587,Young Kim,"Mar 16, 2021 at 4:27 PM","Driving through this pandemic this past year I've had multiple customers complain that they could not get a Lyft ride. Since 1 year ago, as month after month passed, pax would often tell me that they tried to get a Lyft first because it was cheaper but the wait times got longer and longer.

Some of them were hardcore Lyft loyalists, but they have been telling me that around the new year it got really bad with wait times being over 45 minutes at least in Chicago. But recently they said they could not even get one at all! It would say ""Lyfts are unavailable in your area."" Or something like that..

A couple of customers last night told me that they are worried because they think that once Uber finishes off Lyft they're going to jack up the fares even more because then Uber will be a complete total monopoly and they can set the prices wherever they want. Many Uber ants have both apps up. 

Have you seen any dramatic changes in your experience as a driver if you have the Lyft app up?",2021
post-6967959,Cvillegordo,"Mar 25, 2021 at 9:23 PM","As if I needed a reason to make this a personal practice, another 3rd party ride disaster happened last night. 

Just before pickup, text from pax; ""you will be picking up Anton, a friend of mine. He is going to the hospital, his sister just died.""

Ok.

Anton (I assumed) was a disheveled black male of indeterminate age, as I pulled up to the house he was attempting to park a bicycle on it's kickstand. Ok. I waited until he finally gave up and leaned the bike against the house. 

""UBER?""

Yeah. Hop in.

Anton approaches with no mask and a bag of chips. 

You need a mask, and no eating in the car. 

""No problem.""

Puts on mask, rolls chips up into a ball and gets in. Off we go. 

""We need to stop at a church. I'm from Charlottesville, I'll show you where to go.""

Realizing that he didn't order the ride, asking him to put in a stop is pointless, so I ask which church. It's on the way, no biggie. Then he starts giving me directions, loudly, leaning forward towards the front, mask drooping below his chin. I realize he is very intoxicated. The directions turn into excited shouts; ""TURN HERE! NO, THERE! LISTEN TO ME!""

We stop at the church. I turn and say; ""you will not shout at me, and you will wear your mask if you want a ride."" He gets out, leaves the door open and goes to the church door where there are several packages. All the while shouting obscenities at someone on his phone. This all happened in the space of a minute or less. I look in the back seat, chips and crumbs everywhere. F.uck this. I jump out, close the door, toss his chips on the street. End trip, drive away. I hear him bellowing curses for two blocks. One star, call support to document. 

I'm fine with third party rides. Uber needs to step up and strongly warn customers that they are responsible for anyone they place in an Uber. Or, simply not allow it at all.",2021

post-6999219,Young Kim,"Apr 5, 2021 at 5:49 AM","I drove up to a strip club in Stone Park, IL called ""The Gold Room"" (all purple lights outside), and picked up two guys and drove them into downtown Chicago this past Saturday night around 3:00 am. They came in mildly drunk but were incredibly happy. I remarked to them that I was surprised the strip clubs were open again because I had heard they had closed due to covid. The guy behind me told me, ""No man, they reopened. I was so excited that I slapped each of the girls in the as# tonight thanking each of them for getting back to work.""

On the way to downtown, one of the guys became very chatty and started talking a LOT about aliens and how he feels that they either created this world as a 3-D simulation and we are all living in a video game...or they are behind the scenes controlling it completely by assuming key behind the scenes roles. He went so far as to suggest that there are large underground military bases where the world leaders are collaborating with some alien races who wish to study humans. 

I could tell that he had studied a lot into this area, and he mentioned a lot of details about stories he read about famous UFO/alien sightings. Once in a while, his friend would chime in, and say that aliens must exist as there are endless worlds and universes out there. He then discussed how we are all sort of living in a human ""ant farm"" like environment where everything is controlled, and all variables altered to see how humans would react.

When he asked me my opinion on all this, I replied I can agree that there very well could be aliens, but until they show up and affect my life directly I am not interested. I told them that it is cool to ponder, but since I cannot prove or disprove their existence right now, it is not practical for me to think about it. After, he asked me if I had seen any. I told him no. He said he did see some before looking at the night sky with a telescope, and he saw some when he experimented with DMT, a powerful psychedelic drug. 

The ride ended though in sort of a funny way. About 2 minutes from our destination, the more quiet guy sitting on my passenger side rear suddenly ask me to drive faster because he had to go to the bathroom ASAP. I told him that I cannot risk getting a ticket, but if it is an emergency, I can pull over. He said fine and then he would be OK. Then, with about 30 seconds left, he screamed at me, ""Pull over, pull over now, right NOW!"" 

So I stopped quickly, and he got out and then his friend who was talking about all the alien stuff went out and both relieved themselves for a long while by a building wall. After, they both got back in, and the guy on the right said, ""Dude, that was such a relief, thanks a bunch, I am gonna tip you $30 on the app ok!"" Anyways the ride ended, and I was left entertained by those two.",2021

If you're in the area and you like good Italian, check out Tavola. Last night I had a pickup at Tavola; ""JaNAYzha"" with a 4.3 rating. $5 promotion and $2 surge, short ride, why not? (Rhetorical question.) These restaurants are literally side by side, if you stop at one, you're there. Stopped at the PIN, texted the rider, waited 2 minutes and received a text; ""you're at the wrong address."" WTF. I look in my rear view and there she is 30' behind me, on the sidewalk, staring at me. Whatever. So I back up 30'. 4.3 JaNAYzha gets in, off we go. Beep! The rider has modified the trip. My 5 minute ride has magically changed to TWO minutes. Well, I still have the promotion and the surge. Beep! She just added a stop. F..k!!

Long story short; She was going to her house to ""pick up something for work."" I told her 3 minutes when she got out; she said ""I'll be one minute."" She was 3+, I was about to cancel, I have not done it already because I know lots of the other people that work in those restaurants, and at least she works.

post-6999173,Young Kim,"Apr 5, 2021 at 4:51 AM","My first pax of this Sunday night was a guy I drove from Glenview, IL to downtown Chicago. He previously worked in the advertising business but was laid off due to covid. Now, he just started trying to make a living rehabbing houses and flipping them. On the long ride (35 minutes), we talked about a lot of things but mostly he complained about Uber and Lyft these days. He said that he and his friends were ""die hard rideshare loyalists"", but recently he started souring on both companies.

For example, he said that tonight (Easter Sunday), he could not get a Lyft or an Uber for over an hour until I accepted the ride. I drove 15 minutes to pick him up. Before I accepted the ride, he said that both Uber and Lyft told him some message like, ""No drivers in your area, try again soon"" or ""Are you sure you wish to request, limited available cars""...something like that. He was so grateful that I finally picked him up, because he was just about to give up. He told me, ""If you hadn't come, then I would have had to stay overnight with my ex-wife, so thank from the bottom of my heart for that!"" 

He mentioned the ridiculous surge. Lately, he said the prices for both Uber and Lyft were equal or sometimes a lot more than what a taxi used to be. And.... there were no more quick pickup times (5 minutes or less) that he was used to for rideshare. Now, just like the taxi industry before, he would often wait up to an hour (as he was in the suburbs), for an Uber or Lyft to show...or ""none available""...just like the taxis.

Therefore, he voiced active hope that the taxi industry would get themselves back together to shape and make a valiant comeback. We discussed how the Chicago medallions were a high of $385,000 back in 2013. Now, there is no bid... (no buyers). So he hoped that now that the prices are so incredibly low, there could be a chance for the ""left for dead"" taxicab companies to make a comeback...and wished eagerly for them to make an effort.

This got me thinking...

I was actually far happier for a multitude of reasons driving a taxi (part time I drove for Flash Cab and other companies) than driving rideshare for two very evil companies... I felt I had very more control over my destiny driving a cab. Plus, I paid zero attention to whether my car would depreciate, not have to worry that I could be ""deactivated"" for a nonsense complaint, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

The ""interrogator"" - It's pretty normal to be asked how long you've been doing Uber or if it's been busy today. But then there's the one who asks a hundred other questions. Do you like doing Uber? How do you like this car? So you drive Uber and Lyft? How does that work? Do you have another job? If so, tell me all about it! Are you from the area? Married? Kids? What's your craziest story?

I turn the Lyft app on first because it's less ""fussy"" than the stupid Uber app. (""Take a picture of yourself."" Then, ""Now take a picture with your mask on."" And then, ""Now give us a urine sample."" It never ends!) Before I can even get Uber up and running, the Lyft app is sending me a trip. From that point on, it's go-go-go, stacked pings all day for as long as I want to drive. Yes, some of them are for far-away pickups and I decline as many of them as I can. Many days I don't even log-on to Uber.

I hear from a lot of passengers that they have loooong wait times, and sometimes they get a message that no cars are available. Damn! I had one passenger tell me how hard it was for him to get a driver to pick him up, as he was enthusiastically thanking me for coming to get him. I said, ""Well, it *is* my job, dude."" And he goes, ""No, no. One driver told me that he doesn't do passengers anymore, he primarily just does food. Says there's more money in it."" And I thought: Maybe that's why the passenger apps have been so busy these days - drivers are switching to food so they don't have to deal with...you know...people? May be... Maybe if I was in this for the money, I'd deliver food instead too.

People in general are becoming more and more dependent on ride-share to get around, even in the suburbs where there are typically fewer drivers. Lyft and Uber like to send you (meaning: me) all over hell for pickups. Given the option, I don't accept an Uber or Lyft ping that's over 12 minutes away. But Lyft is sneaky - they'll slide a new ride in when you've just begun the first one. I keep the volume on my phone down, so I don't always hear the, ""New standard ride added to queue"" announcement. 

I used to work six hours a day to make my ""target"" revenue. Now I do it in four or five. So I'm kind of with Benjamin M here. I kind of wish there were more drivers out in my town. It's F-ing busy here. And my fear is that the less-satisfied people become with ride-share, the more they'll gravitate back to taxis.",2021

post-6982025,Young Kim,"Mar 30, 2021 at 4:34 PM","In the past week I had at least three pax that told me that they are taking matters into their own hands and not going back to school (or not going to college). last night I picked up a pax at Dave & Buster's in Rosemont Illinois and he was upset that his college experience is being ruined because of covid. He is also irked because Northern Illinois University is not dramatically lowering his tuition costs. Therefore he is dropping out and he is going to try to learn how to program and design video games. He mentioned to me that he doesn't think school has anything like that he cannot learn on his own.

Another student I picked up yesterday was a 3rd-year student from a city college who also was feeling that he can make a lot more money doing things on his own than what he is learning at school. He felt that being an entrepreneur is far better than trying to work for a corporation in the future. He told me last night that he bought three used cars at auction last night and he will fix them up and resell them. He was super excited, and he talked all about how much profit he'd be making.

There was a third guy that just graduated from New Trier high School which is a highly regarded school where a lot of rich kids go to. That ride was about two nights ago and I remember he lived in Winnetka, Illinois which is a very affluent suburb. He was making a lot of money buying premium sneakers from online and in the north side and then he would drive to the south and the west side and sell them to inner city teenagers. He described that he could buy the sneakers himself for about $150 and turn around some of them to some of the teenagers the inner city for $400. He felt that he could make it his full time job after he finishes high school in a couple of months. He showed me his Instagram account where he showed off all of his shoes in his inventory.

I Ieel like at least this could be the start of a trend where a lot of young college age students are feeling that the very high cost of a college education is no longer worth it and doesn't add value.

post-6988807,The Gift of Fish,"Apr 1, 2021 at 5:18 PM","There are a two points of view regarding post-your-boast earnings threads in which people post their earnings in various levels of detail; posting summaries only, providing full breakdowns of individual trips, or anything and everything in between. Some people say that posting earnings guides to one's own market is foolish. Others, judging by the number of them on here, think that they are great. My own opinion is that they certainly are foolish. However, they have also benefitted me, which seems contradictory. Here is my experience.

Late last year I was browsing this forum when I noticed a post-your-boast thread. ""It's HOPPING in my town"", posted the OP, who went on to describe in detail the goings-on in his local market. He had posted a screenshot of the driver app screen of his latest weekly earnings broken down by day, and also screenshots of several individual rides showing the spots that the rides originated, along with the day, date, time and value of each one.

""This is interesting"", I thought. The area advertised by the earnings boaster is a smallish community around 40 miles outside a major metro area in California, which I knew vaguely. I have friends who live very close to it whom I hadn't seen in a while, plus things had been very slow in the Bay Area. I had also felt like taking a little vacation. So I decided to go and visit, and combine a vacation with a chance to make some good money. I had never driven rideshare there but my plan was simple. I would just go to the spots identified by the OP on the days and times advertised by him, turn on the driver app and wait.

And so it happened. One road trip later, I went to the first staging area, turned the app on and waited. Things turned out to be just as the OP had said. Demand was excellent and I soon bagged some great high-dollar rides, and a couple of very high dollar rides. Over the next week I was very pleased with the results. Interestingly, during this time, I picked up the same passenger three times from her house was a couple of miles from where I was staying, indicating that there were few drivers in the area. This, coupled with the nice surges and excellent ping quantity, was evidence of a very favourable demand:driver ratio in the area.

Now, back to the question posed above, regarding whether post-your-boast is a good idea, for both the poster and for me. Let's find the answer with simple cost:benefit analyses. If the benefits outweigh the costs then we'll say that it was a good result, and if benefits do not outweigh the costs, we'll say that it was not a good result.

For me, the costs of the exercise were gas to get to and from the poster's location, and the earnings I did not make in the Bay Area. The benefits were the earnings I made in his area, which exceeded the gas cost and my foregone home earnings by a country mile. So, for me, it was a good result.

For the OP, it's hard to estimate the costs of me working his area. When I accepted the pings there, I obviously denied those rides to all other drivers in the area. Was the driver one of those drivers? Was he working the area on the days and times I was? There's no way to tell. All we know is that it was possible. It's also possible that I was not the only driver attracted into his area by his advertising. Now, let's look at the other side of the analysis - the benefit side to him of advertising his area. This can be summed up as zero. In dollar terms, $0. Nada. As we said above, if the benefits outweigh the costs, then it is a positive result. However, with a benefit of zero, the benefits of advertising one's own area on a public forum can never, by defintion, outweigh the cost. The cost being, of course, the risk of losing business to competitors that one attracted into the area.

In summary, advertising one's area in post-your-boast threads is foolish, but the magnitude of the foolishness depends on the level of detail given. At the top of the tree, we have posting exact hotspots together with the days of the week and times to get good rides there. This will result in immediate competition from other drivers turning up. Further down the list of self-scuppering is the posting of daily earnings totals and the general location of the earnings. While one does not divulge the exact locations and times of the opportunities, it is still persuasive in attracting drivers, both old and new, into one's area. With zero benefit for the poster boaster, it is hard to see how this is a good idea. As seen above, there is no benefit to it for the advertiser. However, for the driver looking for new opportunities and areas to drive in, or for existing drivers who have taken a break and are considering returning to rideshare in their town, these posts can be golden eggs.

Conclusion - keep posting them, please! Just don't do it in my area. :thumbup:",2021

The conversation went in this direction when we talked about what colleges we went to. And we started on the topic of colleges because he had mentioned that I seemed so articulate. I told him I went to the University of Chicago and he lit up with enthusiasm and we talked about economics. He just said matter of factly that after college he unfortunately went to jail for several years because he shot somebody right next to his heart.

I picked up 49 seconds of the conversation but I stopped it after he began to go into great detail and told me his name and the person that he had shot. Obviously I stopped the video at that point. Here is the 49-second clip below which protects his anonymity:


after he told me that he had shot somebody and gone to jail and told me to look up his name on Google. I did so quickly at the next traffic light and indeed it was my passenger and I saw his mugshot. He then told me about how he had been to a couple of state prisons and told me about the life inside prison. Somehow he got out after several years.

He befriended some people with the cartel while inside prison when he was in jail. After leaving jail, he said he started to work for them. When I asked him why he did that because I told him it was so dangerous he said that the money is so good. Also he told me that the women are so plentiful that he has no problem finding beautiful young women all the time. He showed me on his phone at a couple of lights where we were stopped him posing with many beautiful women and him describing that he had been with all of them.

I think he could sense that I didn't quite believe his story (at first) and the reason that I was a little skeptical was honestly I thought to myself that if someone is actively killing somebody why would they tell some total random stranger?

Then he said, ""I could sense that you doubt me so let me show you..."". ""look!"". And then when I turned around he produced what he said was a loaded handgun. I did get scared at first but then I calmed down and then just asked him to put it away. He kept on asking me if I was wearing a wire. He also kept asking me if I wanted to take a bump of cocaine in the car. Naturally I said no to both. I told him that I would never use drugs under any circumstance and especially never while I was driving Uber.

I thought if I should try to get help while I was in the ride I figured it would not be a good idea to antagonize somebody in the situation that I was in. I quickly looked at the name on my app and it was not the name of my passenger. So I thought to myself if something were to happen then there wouldn't be any way to necessarily track him.

So I just stayed calm and listened to him tell stories of people that he's killed. They were both targets in Mexico and the US. He said he particularly asks for pedophiles and women beaters. Tell me about the fees that he collects and they're usually between three and $5,000 in the US. The most he got was $25,000. He described that there was a code of course of no women no children... however there were some unusual circumstances where things like that were allowed.

then he went into some graphic detail and asked me if I ever saw somebody's head getting cut off. I remember him also asking me if I ever saw several ks of cocaine live right in front of me. Then he told me about the time that he saw somebody get drawn and quartered by five different cars. Like they would tie each limb and the head to five different cars and then drive in different directions. It went into more graphic detail about people being boiled alive and many other things I won't go into.

it almost seemed like he was telling me his autobiography because he told me about names locations places he's done hits...I was extremely utterly surprised that he would go into such detail with somebody he did not know.

Anyway the ride ended and like I said I stayed very very calm and collected and I didn't report it to Uber or anything else. In fact he told me that the name on the account was just someone untraceable so I wouldn't even need to bother. Besides he told me that I could tell someone his story but I couldn't use any personal details... and I did not here. He did very calmly tell me it would be a shame that someone so cool and smart like me would suddenly disappear.

I wanted to share the story because it was highly unusual and it was probably the very first time while driving a passenger that I felt a little tingle of fear. I did not embellish or exaggerate even a single detail of the story here.

Yet another adventure in Chicago on a late Saturday night...

if I suddenly stop posting on this forum without any warning you will all know what happened to me ...and besides I would be on the news anyway... Be well everyone!",2021

So this week I picked up a pax who just clocked off a 12 hour shift and was going to his girlfriend's place....he asked me if I ""wouldn't mind"" going to the drive thru liquor store so he could bring over a 6-pack. 

These are the kinds of overtures I ALWAYS turn down (because it opens up a portal of time wastage and drama)...I was about to say ""no sorry"" but then glanced through my mirror at this guy who had gotten off his shift and just wanted to relax with his woman and beer, and I thought...I can do it just this one. 

We stop at the drive thru liquor store, he orders his 6-pack but ""can't find his ID"" and the cashier won't make an exception for him... he's really frustrated and tells me ""hey, lets just get outta here"", so I put the car in drive, but then again look at through the mirror at him, pause, put the car in park, call the cashier back and say ""I'm ordering what he just ordered"".

The pax passed a $20 up to the front seat, I pay and try give him the 6-pack and this change, and says ""no mann, just keep it"".

I dropped the pax off...drove off and realized I had unwittingly performed a random act of kindness toward a pax.",2021
post-6946705,Young Kim,"Mar 18, 2021 at 4:18 PM","My last pax of the night I found particularly interesting because her story was unique. She had found a sugar daddy. I picked her up around the Edison Park Illinois area and brought her to the DoubleTree hotel in downtown Chicago. We got to talking and I asked her how the pandemic has affected her.

She told me that it was pretty rough when the pandemic started because she had been working at McCormick place as one of those young women who are hired to promote displays. it's a business convention center and frequently they hire young ladies to cater to the businessmen who are coming in and show off whatever company they're representing.

During one of the conventions an older gentleman had befriended her and they exchanged phone numbers somehow. After some communication they didn't talk for a little while. Once the pandemic struck, she lost all of her gigs at the convention center,... some of which paid her upwards of $38 per hour to basically stand there.

Is she contacted the older gentleman and they made an agreement. He would come into town and pay her visit in a hotel... and they would I guess be companions for the short time he was in Chicago. She actually has a young son that she must take care of so meeting him and him agreeing to be her supporter was quite fortunate for her.

I asked gently her if she enjoyed his company and the entire arrangement, and she seemed just okay with it. Like she didn't say that she really loved him or that she hated him or anything like that. For her it was just kind of a business arrangement to help her support herself and her young son. Of course she didn't tell me the amount, and obviously I didn't ask but she said that he sends her money every month

I thought this was interesting because during this pandemic people must cope in all sorts of different ways. She was actually the first person I met who actually had a real sugar daddy. she did tell me that he was happily married with children., But that did not bother her because of course that's not what she wanted because he was probably around 50 years old. I couldn't be sure but he actually came out to greet her cuz he was so excited, so I got to briefly see him.",2021

post-6978243,MyJessicaLS430,"Mar 29, 2021 at 2:02 PM","While I have no idea how the glorious days were like when these RS companies first emerged, there is no question that the rates are paltry these days. With the combination of multiple rate cuts, deteriorating passengers and the pandemic, I have decided to quit once and for all.

Recently I have been obsessed with deliveries, most of which are grocery shopping. At first it sounds ridiculous to me to be paid Uber rate to not only transport cargoes but also include the shopping component. Contrary to my expectation, this is very addicting. Don't be mistaken, I am not saying grocery shopping gigs are better than Ubering in any part. Although the base pay is about $6, consider the amount of time needed to complete one delivery, this is certainly not worth the effort without any incentives. What I mean by ""incentives"" are in nature, not the useless badges and ratings.

First, I love the upfront information about expected pay, time to completion and pick-up and drop-off locations, all of which we are supposed to be entitled to, not to be provided only if certain outrageous criteria are met. Here comes the best part, the monetary incentives. Depending on the local markets and time, the estimated payout (with bonus included) can be far more attractive than doing rides, not to mention you will have full control of where to end up after a delivery. Needless to say, how much we take home is also highly dependent on the willingness of customers to tip. However, if you are the type that withdraw every penny after each delivery, this may not work for you because there is a $500 cap. Personally I have no problem for these companies to keep the money for a year if there is a minimum of 1% interest rate &#128514;.




Finally, I am also astonished by the real time support. For instance, a transaction will be denied by default when customers request additional items after we accept an order. It only takes a minute or two for the support to override the payment authorization. They are also very helpful to assign a return for unsuccessful deliveries. Since not every store accepts return because of the pandemic, basically I have free food plus the $5 to drive back to the store. The only time that happened to me also include some adult products. Um may be I should consider selling them.",2021

She is having difficulty figuring out how to get the bag to the curb and subsequently has difficulty lifting it. The able-bodied, bald-headed PDA gets back into his car and doesn't assist the elderly lady. I back up so I don't maul her over and squeeze into a nice tight pathway to exit.

Today, no decent pings downtown for delivery, so I decided flip on X. And, for the first time since the pandemic, I was getting stacked pings with surges, airport trips, and people hitting the town. Just like old times.

My action to be fix the issue to be able to make appointment with DMV, almost impossible, and managed to get appointment 40 miles away in 45 days.
I have submitted all supporting documents and request the report to be corrected to both Court (still closed) and DMV as well.
Briefly> almost 6 months ago I hit in parking lot, no damage to my car at almost zero speed.
Receive letter from DMV to file the accident report, indicated at the time of accident I did not had insurance coverage. I had official letter from my personal insurance indicated at the time of accident no fault , no damage and no gapes in coverage for even 11 months period. as well since my Uber app was on, I spoke to all state indicated fr my part no action needed, and of course fax the accident report.
on 11.29 3.30 am, on the way to pick up rider, stopped by officer going faster than limit, but I was told my license suspended , 5 days prior to that date, of courseI did not know and the reason not reporting accident report. within 8 hours I was able to contact DMV by phone and they located the fax and removed the suspension, right away I contacted police department and spoke to officer to gave back my license, he refused and told me he will send it to DMV, waited couple weeks, 20 miles away to get my replacement. I send a letter to court, regarding the ticket ($460 charge for suspension), my mistake, the clerk told me, the court closed and judge willing to reduce the charge, I thought ok, they had to remove suspension charge, she did not indicated they changed the suspension to driving without driver license, that, s the code Uber wants to be corrected, as the result I had to let my car go, financed just for driving Uber. and Cheker wont accept any documents to support my case. to me Uber as well does not care about responsible drivers and at least look at the facts, not report that may takes months to be resolved during Covid.",2021

post-6970461,Young Kim,"Mar 26, 2021 at 5:00 PM","I dropped off a passenger to Gary Indiana. The ride only took about 31 minutes from the south side of Chicago! He and his sister actually work in Chicago but they live in Gary Indiana, because he said that it was so much safer than living in the south side of Chicago where there is much more crime. We entered his suburb and I remember asking him ""how much do houses cost around here?""

I was stunned at his answer. He told me his house cost him only about $15,000 before closing costs last year. He said there was a slightly renovated one that was a few houses down that was $40,000. I was kind of in disbelief because his subdivision was not dilapidated or run down at all.

granted this was the night so I couldn't get a good look but there did not seem to be any trash or any boarded-up houses or lawns that seemed not well-maintained. It just looked like any other subdivision that you might find in Chicagoland. When I finished the ride I remember I went on redfin and verified that houses in his subdivision really were only about 15 to $40,000 in that area!

I just was so stunned that houses could be so cheap. this is before the pandemic but I remember I went on craigslist and I saw a parking space in river north Chicago which is in downtown Chicago selling for $55,000! And that was just a parking space! To be able to purchase a home for between 15 to $20,000 it just seems so incredible.

Indeed a 30-40-minute drive to downtown Chicago is not very close but if you can get a house for next to nothing,...well I can imagine why some people would choose to live out there.

This will make the 4th and 5th bottles of wine left in my car over the years. I have not checked the value of them yet, they don't look like anything fancy.

post-6957837,Fusion_LUser,"Mar 22, 2021 at 3:26 PM","I had a good Friday/Saturday evening last weekend and I was at home catching up on a book with the TV on when I got a ping for a long ride! My longest ride by far at 175+ miles. Before this request my longest ride was about 86 miles. I had been sitting at 3.5x starting around 3PM and did take a quick ride around 4PM for $38 but then Uber signed me out and forced me to take a selfie which I did. When I signed back in I forgot to change my fare multiplier so if I was at 3.5x who knows if I would have even got the 175+ mile ride... There were other ants available so I was surprised it came in at 2.1x. I guess the other ants didn't want the ride...

Anyway I saw the amount and did a quick screen shot then accepted the ride, thinking it was a high surge ride to Santa Barbara in the $300 range. It wouldn't be my first $300+ ride to Santa Barbara so I was OK with the blind accept. I then looked at the screen shot and saw it was to LA! Oh man, do I want to do this at 6PM on a Sunday???

So I go to The Boss who is prepping her lesson plan and for the next two minutes or so we talk about the ride...

I have a juicy $300 or more ride. Gotta go!
Where?
LA!
LA! Are you serious?
<mumbling> yes
You are going to LA at this time? You won't be back for hours!
It's gonna be like $50 an hour so why not?
CUZ IT'S LA!
Should I cancel?
It's up to you, that's a long ride. You are just watching TV so go, be safe!

After that nod of approval I did a quick bathroom break, grabbed a Rockstar and took off at 6:30PM. The pick up was near me in a newer part of town and a father/uncle/lover/pimp with his daughter/niece/lover/hooker was waiting for me. Just the lady got in my car and didn't speak one word of English. I confirmed the address with the guy and off we went. The lady fell asleep within 20 minutes and was slumped over in the back seat for about an hour and then just kept to herself in the backseat, it was like nobody was even there.

The ride was non-eventful until about 20 minutes from our destination. She took a speakerphone call in Chinese and then out the blue she just put her phone right up to my face! I could not see anything but the blue screen in my right eye! She said ""talk"" and the person on the phone was saying ""Hello?""... I took the phone, said hello and the person just wanted to confirm the drop-off. I said that's the place and that was that.

I did miss a turn in LA, it was dark and there was a lot of traffic so I had to do a U-Turn at a light and a guy waiting for her at a Chinese restaurant when we arrived at 9:15PM. Both said thanks and off they went. Uber paid over $317 and they gave a $60 tip. Not bad for the first 3 hours!

I was getting ping after ping for local rides anywhere from $2 (outrageous... who the hell drives for $2???) up to $20 but I didn't know the locations and I didn't want to go out of my way so I turned on the trip filter and I was still getting a lot of pings! I did see one 2.0x for $25 to $29 from Union Station to Studio City (about 17 miles) and took that. I got another ride at 1.8x for $44 ($24 plus $20 cash tip) from the Warner Center in Woodland Hills up to Calabasas that was not much out of the way at all. I got sporadic pings for the last 150 miles home that I ignored.

I get home at 12:45AM... 6 hours and 15 minutes total for the 3 rides and one bathroom stop in Ventura... 345 miles and just a little over $450 for doing the entire trip. I used about a half tank of gas... I started with a little over 3/4 and ended with a little less than a 1/4.

post-6945989,Young Kim,"Mar 18, 2021 at 12:52 PM","I had a pickup in Mount prospect Illinois with a pax named Margaret who was going to a bar in Schaumburg Illinois. Hers was a fascinating story about how covid changed her life and completely turned everything around.

She works currently for Comcast and is a technical support agent. She said that when the pandemic struck last year they offered everyone who worked a 25% bonus in their hourly salary. Then because of the pandemic she was promoted finally to being a manager.. with a big salary raise in addition to the 25% bump.

Then all the sudden she said she felt like she hit the jackpot because Comcast said that everyone could work remotely. She said that was such a relief because she said that initially her office was in Schaumburg then they moved her to oakbrook and then finally to Bolingbrook Illinois. Her commute times went from 12 minutes to 30 minutes to 1 hour when she finally got located to Bolingbrook Illinois. The commute was killing her because sometimes when there was traffic it would be an hour and a half back home..

she loved being able to just work from her pajamas because she doesn't even have to be seen since she's a technical support agent. Then recently she said that they introduced at Comcast a text support feature. that means she doesn't even have to be on the phone anymore with a headset! She said that was a godsend because she was sick and tired of having to continue to talk to customers who would ramble on and on. She didn't have to talk over them anymore. 

She said she could also listen to music which she said was a first while she was working. She would just blast music and then she'd be on video with friends just hanging out. Sometimes she would just go to friends homes and even restaurants and just do her work from there.

She also said that she had just recently bought a brand new car because her old one broke down. But because of the pandemic she said that she was able to sell her car to her friend who gave her a very good price. so now she no longer has a car payment or has to pay for any insurance and just takes Uber when she needs to go somewhere but she says it's not often.

She said with all the promotions in the bump up and pay and the incredibly relaxing work and being able to sell her car that her finances completely turned around. She told me that she's saving up so much money for extended vacations to Italy and France and all around the world. she said she could never save money before the pandemic. She just yesterday got her third stimulus bonus by direct deposit as well.

She admitted that she feels terrible about this because she's knows a lot of people have gotten sick and died and she feels guilty about admitting to anybody how she feels. but she admitted to me that she's had a hard life and after years and years of difficult times, the universe finally rewarded her personally with the pandemic... She said her life was now better than ever. Better than it's ever been in her entire life.

I asked him and he said he easily busts 1-2 drivers a day just by cruising into the waiting area at random. It's a big ticket too he said. Also, a lot of vehicles with evident body damage get their TNC licence pulled on the spot if they get caught. That is also as frequent according to him.

As bad as she was the girlfriend appears at 5 minutes as I was about to cancel but the boyfriend was chill and said sorry about this... ""It's her birthday...""

This is the most lily-white chick I have ever seen. Take every white chick from a John Hughes film and combined them all and you have the birthday girl. However *every* other word out of her mouth was ""*****"" and/or ""****"". In to the car she sits yelling ""It's my birthday N***as! Lets party!""

We get out of the parking lot...

Where the **** are we going?
To the bar like you said you want to go...
Uber I just ****ing want you to know it's my BIIIIIIIIRRRRRTTHHHHDAY!
I get to ****ing be obnoxious on my BIRTHHHHHHDDAYYYY!
What's your name Mr. Uber?
Fusion....
Well it's my ****ing birthday. Let's party N***as!

We are not 2 minutes in to the drive and the boyfriend says save the partying for the bar.

**** THAT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY N***a! We ****ing gotta party.
Well chill for the bar you can't party here... 
<cutting the BF off> Uber doesn't ****ing care!
Uber I can have fun at my ****ing birthday right?
We've been partying all day and we are going to the bar to party. Chill!

Now the Birthday Girl gets super quiet. YAY!

We should ****ing just go back to the hotel since you N***as don't want to party.
Why the **** are we even going to the ****ing bar. This sucks. My birthday sucks.
Don't be like it's been a great day and we can party at the bar.
**** that I don't want to go to the bar anymore.
Well we are going because you want to go!

The last two minutes everyone was quiet and she was digging for something in her purse. We arrive at the bar the boyfriend and friend get out. The birthday girl doesn't. She is ""****ing looking for that cool gift she got from Wayne/Dwayne"" or whatever name she said...

Don't forgot your phone.
I'm not stupid I ****ing know where my ****ing phone is N**ga!
Where is the ****ing gift I got? Oh here it is. Look at this Uber!

It's been almost a minute now I'm done and said ""I have another ride I need to go pick up""

**** YOU N***A I WAS JUST BEING NICE. **** YOU *****"" as she gets out and slams the passenger side rear door.

She immediately opened the door again and screamed ""**** YOU *****"" and slammed it again. I locked the doors quickly this time and drove off. I did see the boyfriend laughing so now I'm like **** that guy! I went to another parking lot to file a complaint with Uber when I get a call from Uber messing the little complaint I was writing. Then the Birthday Girl's iPhone in the back seat starting ringing!!!

I don't answer my cell but I answer her cell phone and the nicest way I could

Hellooooooo
Hi this is blah blah blah we left our phone in your car
Would that be the phone of the loud chick or the **** you ***** chick?
Yeah sorry about that can you bring the phone back?

I can hear the Birthday Girl in the back say get my ****ing phone back I need that N***a!

I hang up.

Phone rings...

Hellllllllooooooooooo!
I'm really sorry guy we just want the phone back. Bring it back.

The birthday girl is still in the background yelling ""if that ****ing Uber if he doesn't bring my phone back right now I'm ****ing calling the police and reporting it ****ing stolen.""

Dude that chick was the most disrespectful person I've come by doing rideshare. Not only did she yell **** you ***** for no reason and slam my car door she did it twice while you sat there laughing! Tell **** you ***** girl I'm tossing her phone she can come find it.

No I was not laughing come on give me a break bring the...

I hang up. The whole time we are talking I'm heading for a gas station that has a porta-potty outside. I get there and it's gone! So I went a few doors down to a McDonald's with the phone ringing until I powered it off. I put some gloves on, cut open a trash bag right at the top of the trash bin and drop the phone inside it! The trash was nasty, smelly and wet.

I got two more calls from Uber but I didn't answer as I filed the complaint with Uber and said nothing about the lost phone. I got the canned response saying they will take this situation seriously blah blah blah and so far nothing about the phone. As of right now no drop in stars... I don't care if they do leave a bad feedback...",2021
post-6945953,Young Kim,"Mar 18, 2021 at 12:33 PM","One of my riders last night was a pickup from downtown Chicago going to a Northwest suburb last night. His name was Augustus. Nice conversation to start. I talked about sports (Cubs and Blackhawks) and then the weather. (There was rain last night in Chicago)

Then he suddenly asked me a question from out of the blue... ""What did you think about what happened during the elections?"". (My interior caution light went off of immediately). So I proceeded with caution...

I told him ""I'm not sure what happened but I know a lot of people thought there was some suspicious activity in the election"".

(Augustus): thank goodness I found someone else who agrees with me and half the country.

(Me). well I really can't comment too much because I don't know enough about the matter but what I read on various news outlets was that there was really irregular voting activity.

(Augustus). I looked out myself personally in Wisconsin and saw that there were more votes for the senators in the state than for the president. Who would go to a voting booth and not vote for the president? Also how could biden have gotten more votes than Obama? Why was there reports of hours passing in certain voting booths with 100% of the votes going for Biden and none for Trump? There was massive massive voting mail in ballot fraud.

(Me) not sure. I can see why many people would consider that.

(Augustus). You know it's really hard being a Republican in Chicago right?

(Me). Yes indeed. if you wore a red maga hat in downtown Chicago I think people would start hitting you.

(Augustus)...(he went on and on and on about how the Democratic policies were just destroying the country. He brought up how he thinks Kamala Harris is certainly going to become president if not Nancy pelosi. He told me that if Biden cannot serve 2 years then Nancy pelosi automatically according to the law becomes the president. (I'm not sure myself). He talked about how President Biden when he reads a teleprompter once he read the closed captioning brackets that introduced the next event. He said Biden was completely utterly demented, who is a puppet who is hiding in the basement. He continued saying Trump will prevail again in 2024. A lot of lies he said were spoken about the Democrats about the lethality of the virus... It went on and on and on ..and on.

(Me). (I just kept silent, trying to keep my integrity by not totally agreeing with the stuff about Trump's absolute greatness, vaccine data, masks, etc. BUT at the same time not arguing with Augustus. I stayed pleasant calm and polite throughout the entire interaction and ride. And listened with intention.)

At the end of the ride I found a $22.23 tip on my app...

post-6953857,The Gift of Fish,"Mar 21, 2021 at 5:42 AM","Uber recently lost its challenge in the UK courts to have its drivers classified as independent contractors. In a nutshell, the UK Supreme Court judged Uber's claims that it is merely a software platform that links pax and drivers to be nonsense, and that its drivers are indeed employees. Uber's reaction to making its UK drivers employees?



And:



So, in the UK, Dara and Co. accept that the UK ruling that its drivers are employees is a clearer path forward in giving its workers rights, and that it is willing to change its ways.

However, in California, the company sings along to a completely different tune. Voters decided in the Prop 22 election that Uber's drivers are not employees, but independent contractors. Uber's reaction?



And:



In California, Uber praises voters for deciding the polar opposite of the UK, and that decision to  class its drivers as employees is the best for the drivers.

Double-speak much? We, as drivers, have known for a long time that Uber has its bullshit generator running 24/7. However, up until now, the bullshit had largely been consistent. Now, Uber demonstrates that it will say whatever it thinks will benefit it the most, adapting the rhetoric at will to whatever situation it finds itself in, regardless of any contradictions with previously published positions.

Such duplicity would worry me greatly as an investor, particularly with reference to Dara's claims surrounding promised future profitability. However, with Uber's stock price still on an upward trend, none of this seems to worry the market. Go figure.

post-6953519,ng4ever,"Mar 21, 2021 at 12:46 AM","It seems ok but just another way for customers to cheap out. We don't need cheaper services with need higher quality services that pay 80% of the fee to the driver always. I think a minimum fee of something would work even if it was only a few blocks. It would help filter out bad customers kinda. Not always though of course.

Anyway the service is where you use the customers car to drive. Not exactly sure how it works but it seems ok. At least your not putting wear and tear on your own car. Though I see disadvantages of this for the driver somewhat. What do you all think ? Good service idea by whoever created it? It is like $22 or $23 a hour depending on where you live. Seems like not enough for the driver.

post-6932385,dtwguy,"Mar 14, 2021 at 1:38 AM","This evening I picked up a passenger in Detroit. They weren't at the pick up location. I figured out that they were around the corner and down the street. When I got there they immediately started calling me names after getting in the car. Soon, they began calling me ""gay"", ""******ed"", ""ugly ass"" and using the N word repeatedly. 

I asked them to stop swearing and to just confirm their drop off (since the pick up was incorrect) and name. They continued to call me names and swear, yelling at me. Eventually, I called Lyft's emergency ride number. The ADT rep was wonderful. After hearing a few seconds of this, including the threats to ""F up my gay ****** ass"" they recommended calling the police or immediately ending the ride. I explained that the passenger was four minutes away and there was no easy way to get them out of the car. They said they would stay with me out of a concern for my safety. 

They continued to yell similar racial and other hateful comments as I drove (""no one will ever suck your Dxxx you ugly gay ******""). I remained silent and got them to their destination. Fortunately they got out, while still threating to kill me. 

The ADT safety rep was wonderful. She was kind and recognized that I was in shock. She offered assistance and stayed with me until I could breathe again. 

Lyft? They sent me an email asking me to call them. When I did they said they were too busy and to send them an email. 

Oh, and while I was on the phone with ADT emergency support they assigned me a new pick up. I'm a 5 star drive so I pulled it together and drove there. The passenger didn't show up. After waiting ten minutes and calling and texting six times I cancelled. I received a message that ""I needed to drive close"" even though I was a foot from the front door"". I'm still trying to get my cancellation fee. Fortunately I took a phot of me right under the address and at the front door! 

Meanwhile, there is a disturbed passenger out there willing to make multiple threats to kill a Lyft driver - and Lyft could care less. 

Be safe out there.

She's probably still waiting there. The cheese has taken almost all the drivers off the road here.

At least this is better than the reason-challenged question I get from pax ""Im right behind you, don't you see me?!"", as if drivers have eyes in backs of their heads to see you standing behind their car.

Nothing unusual about that, but I then got a text from the pax, ""Skip"", asking me to call him. I don't usually phone or take calls from pax, but it was a reasonably good trip in the direction I wanted to go, so I hit the Call Passenger button in the Uber app. The phone rang out and nobody answered. Then ""Skip"" texted me that he wanted me to call him on a different number. I obviously refused. ""Skip"" then claimed that it was necessary for me to phone him in order ""to confirm"" and ""to be safe"", which makes no sense. Anyway, in the end I ""skipped"" the ride - ending this encounter with [cancel as no show / 4 bucks for me / thanks for playing / try again soon].

The last text that ""Skip"" was typing in the screenshot below was a rather desperate sounding ""Call me!!!!"".

Maybe it's a new fishing technique to get drivers' numbers so that ""support"" can phone them later directly to pull the scam where they offer drivers a bonus in exchange for handing over their login details?

I would whip out bumble or tender whenever someone hot pinged me. I’d get the date app pulled up and start swiping as the passenger was walking up. They’d get in and see i would have bumble and then mention something like “omg your on bumble too” and BAM you’ve got them thinking about dating and the conversation started. I’d follow it up with something like “I’m new at this, I just downloaded the app and thought I’d give it a try, I’m not too sure how it works”. This was like chum in the water. Play innocent, she might ask to switch upfront and wanna look at your phone to see your profile and your face up close. Keep some fire matches in your bumble deck so when she looks at your phone she notices you’ve got hot woman you’ve already matched with, this will bring out her competitive spirit and make her just a bit insecure and jealous. Trust me you’ll actually appear more attractive #ProTip. Also, Have a GOOD profile picture. Men I cannot emphasize this enough. Be sure you have a nice headshot, no double chin taken from the front seat of your car. Get in good lighting, put a nice shirt on, wash your face and comb your hair and use your portrait mode selfie in good lighting then upload it to Lyft. Accentuate that jaw! Ok, now back to my advice. She’s chatting with you now! This will lead into 1 of 2 avenues. 1 she’s taken or uninterested, in that case she will usually give you tips on your profile and you can max out your bumble game or 2 she’s single and y’all hit it off and you get her number.

post-6912351,Young Kim,"Mar 7, 2021 at 6:54 AM","I picked up a pax in Chicago, and as we talked, he said to me, ""You seem like a very knowledgeable guy, could you please give me advice on what to do with my girlfriend?"" ""We are having issues."" His real name I remember was Lorenzo. (I don't see an issue with saying his real name because he did not disclose anything illicit or extremely personal...it is just sort of an innocent story). I replied, ""OK, I'll try to do my best."" He said, ""Well, my girlfriend said we should try to stop something we are doing... and be more responsible"". (I wondered if it was something bad like drugs or gambling or overspending). 

He went on to say that his girlfriend is starting to feel guilty about how they are sexually active. Lorenzo said that he wanted to get married to her soon, and she expressed that she felt the same about him. The issue was that she felt if they are planning to get married, she should not be sexually active prior to marriage. She said that there was a thing about ""re-virginizing oneself"". He said he was frustrated that he would have to wait for sexual fulfillment. He said he was 32 years old, and his girlfriend was 28. 

At least to me, he was very gentle, sort of shy, and the sort of person that could not hurt a fly. I remarked to him about this, how gentle and kind he seemed, and he said that has always been his personality. I asked him about his girlfriend (advising him not to get too personal) and he said his girlfriend was the same. I then asked if religion had anything to do with his girlfriend wanting to ""re-virginize"" herself (I pondered if she was Muslim, where pre-marital sex is particularly frowned upon. 

He told him that both he and his girlfriend were Christian. I then asked him, ""Do you want to marry her then? Do you see a forever long term relationship with her?"" Without hesitation, he said that he does, and that there is no other for him. So then I advised him, ""Well, then bro, the answer is obvious... get married right away, don't wait. If you know she is ""the one"", and she is going to withhold sex from you now, then just get married immediately"".

He replied that the issue was his family was very very large, and that both of them talked about it and how having a wedding during this pandemic would be exceedingly difficult. So they felt they needed to wait...

I then suggested a solution that he got really happy to hear... I told him that a few of my younger cousins secretly got married this year, just in court, without telling anyone in the family. They did so for many reasons, and they did not want to say just invite a few people in the family and have others feel left out. But, they immediately told everyone in the family through a group e-mail that they plan to have the BIG family wedding AFTER the pandemic restrictions lift and then everyone will feel included.

This solution seemed to surprise Lorenzo, and he said, ""Omg, why didn't I think of that before?!"" He thanked me profusely, and seemed incredibly happy. Then he said that he would propose the idea to his girlfriend right away. After he left, I could tell that at least he was sincere because he left a $5 tip on a rather short ride. Sometimes, we ants have to play therapist. In this case, I found a solution that the pax really appreciated. 

Question for my fellow ants...have you also had a situation where you found a keen solution to a relationship issue that the pax latched onto?

(The next day I asked some female friends that I have if ""re-virginizing"" is a thing before marriage....and I found that many of them agreed with Lorenzo's girlfriend.... that many women do this to buttress their feelings of innocence and integrity as a lady. I suppose that I learn every day. I heard of this, but I really did not know how prevalent such a thing really was.)",2021

I of course would have thought of cancelling if they stumbled towards my car, but all three walked just fine.

But after they got into the car, I knew at least two were completely smash drunk. The girlfriend of one of the pax slumped over onto her boyfriend's shoulder almost immediately and passed out. Jose, the pax who ordered was sitting behind me slurring his speech profoundly. The boyfriend of the girl seemed OK, and spoke to me and Jose. As we drove, the boyfriend spoke to Jose and they discussed how awesome the night was, and Jose remarked about how utterly completely smash drunk he was, and how he vomited in the bathroom many times.

I could tell this was the case, as there was a stench of vomit as he spoke. (I think other ants could attest to this, you know the smell...) The boyfriend then told me that they do this a lot, go out and get completely smash drunk. Jose then told me and the boyfriend (of the girl who has passed out) how much he enjoyed the night.

I wondered about this, why people do this? I got drunk once..........but just . The experience was so physically uncomfortable and I hated the feeling of a loss of control. It would be like if I was driving a car, and the steering wheel got a ton of ""play"" in it, and the brakes were sluggish, and the accelerator did not respond, etc. Can anyone comment as to why people do this? I can not fathom how someone would regularly subject themselves to experiencing profound bodily sickness and a psychological loss of control.

Anyhow, when we got to the destination, all three got out, but the girlfriend was so disoriented. Suddenly, as she was walking, she collapsed onto the pavement...hard. I was shocked and got out, and I saw that Jose and the boyfriend lifted her and she seemed OK and smiled in an embarrassed way at me. I asked if she was OK, and all three assured me that she was. The two guys put her arms on their shoulder, and walked a few steps towards their apartment complex. But.....suddenly both Jose AND the girlfriend collapsed onto the pavement. (Not slowly falling down, and putting their outstretched hands down)...but just fell flat very fast and hard! I was alarmed and asked the boyfriend if they needed an ambulance. But he said no. I cautiously watched them to observe them for a few minutes. They got up and all three went in shoulder to shoulder and sort of did a dance swaying side to side moving as one body....until they disappeared right in the hallway.

I am writing about this because I have documented before on UP.net some very alarming instances of brutal intoxication. Can anyone hazard a guess as to why some pax do this on a routine basis? It appears to me some type of mental issue or masochism. Maybe once I can understand (never to be repeated), but to get smash drunk many times a month year after year and be pleased with the experience?

At least they were taking an Uber home....",2021
post-6916917,Young Kim,"Mar 8, 2021 at 6:28 PM","First trip last night in Chicago was some guy named Brian who told me that he had just finished a marathon run on playing Magic the Gathering with many friends...12 hours of it! He and his friends were overjoyed because they were all celebrating as a result of the massive stimulus being passed. He was a laid off worker from an advertising company in Chicago named Leo Burnett. 

We talked about his group of friends who he was playing the games with, and one of them was a laid off airline engine mechanic at O'Hare airport. I can't now remember the airline. Anyway he said that his friend was asked back by the airline to start work again. He told me his friend refused, because of the extended unemployment until September. his friend said that even though there's little chance of getting covid at his job because he is an airline mechanic, he is entitled to a very long paid vacation after putting in so much time with the airline. His other friends also felt the same way. I browse through other websites on my downtime. Majority of laid off workers with the extended unemployment/ PUA all feel that they deserve this gravy train. 

I hope that finally when they have to go back to work they're prepared to do so and keep their job skills up-to-date. as for the airline mechanic I'm afraid that his job might not be waiting for him when he's finally ready to return. his job is not like driving for Uber where you can just log on and start taking rides.",2021
post-6912419,Young Kim,"Mar 7, 2021 at 8:02 AM","Weekends are when I get my best stories, and I thought this one was interesting. I picked up a pax named William near the Merchandise Mart train station in downtown Chicago, and we got to discussing the pandemic and how he was dealing with it. He shared with me that just over a year ago, he was let go from the most fun job he ever had. He was working for Yelp! (the company who does the online reviews for restaurants and local businesses). He said that it was by far the most fun he ever had, and he was making great money.

William said that the top salesman for the downtown Chicago office made over $30,000 in commission in a month! before the pandemic crushed business. He said he was one of the top salesman and made six figures. And......he loved the environment. He told me about how there was pre-pandemic nearly 1000 people in the Yelp! downtown office, and after you go through security, it was a job workplace heaven. He gave the funny analogy that the ""pit"" where everyone was selling was like in the movie ""Wolf of Wall Street"", and how when someone got a big sale, everyone would know because some ""horn"" would go off and everyone would go over and congratulate the salesman. (He mentioned though there was no drugs or dwarfs thrown).

The pax told me that there were ping pong tables, other amenities like board games and lounge chairs (to be used during break), and FREE BEER and FREE FOOD! And he said it was very good food, all you can eat. I was surprised because I thought that only like Amazon, Facebook, and Google had this type of workplace amenities. I didn't know Yelp! had that kind of money.

William told me that the company really cared about making employees happy. He said that as the pandemic crushed business, Yelp! tried hard to keep as many people onboard and on payroll. He said that he started working remotely from home, but it was totally soul crushing. After all, restaurants and businesses closed down, and trying to get new clients was darn near impossible, he said.

He said Yelp! paid some bonuses and tried and tried,...but in the end, it was not enough, and he and most everyone was let go. He said there is still a shell left of his team in the downtown Chicago office, and he has no ill will towards his former company because they tried so hard to survive, but the Chicago location collapsed anyhow. After a few months on UI, he found a job with FedEx as a driver, and he was being dropped off in the Niles, IL location (by Touhy ave and Niles Center road). He seemed happy enough as a FedEx employee, and we both discussed that business was BOOMING for FedEx and his job is likely secure as an ironclad chain.

But wistfully, he lamented the loss of the best job he said he ever had in his life....",2021
post-6912647,ANT 7,"Mar 7, 2021 at 10:20 AM","This is from the.........""I wouldn't believe it unless I saw it myself""..........files.

Yesterday at about 1145 AM I was stuck at a red light in heavy traffic in front of a McDonald's drive thru. Apparently, two vehicles had tried to enter the single D/T lane at the same time, a white van (who was in the right, appeared to have been first, and had the legal ROW regardless) and a red Ford Taurus that was trying to butt in front of him by entering from the busy avenue I was stuck on (which is illegal to stand/stop on when trying to enter the D/T lanes of this McD).

Dude in the van is calmly talking out his window to the Taurus pax, when the driver of the Taurus exits his vehicle and walks over to the van and proceeds to start punching the van driver. So, the van driver backs up, parks, and exits his vehicle with his cell phone held in a position that made it obvious he was filming. Taurus driver grabs the cell and throws it Tom Brady style across all four lanes of traffic, where it bounces against the side of the wall of a Money Mart, and lands on the sidewalk. Yes, it was that kind of neighbourhood.

Van driver runs across the traffic, grabs his phone, turns and runs back across the traffic, but doesn't stop. He picks up speed and when he is about 5 feet from the Taurus driver, he jumps in the air Bruce Lee style and lands a left food directly on the Taurus driver's jaw sending him to the ground like a wet towel. An EPIC take down to say the least.

Taurus drivers G/F gets out of the car yelling ""OMG you've killed Johnny""........he's not dead BTW, he's just lying flat on the parking lot like J/C about to get nailed to the cross. Van driver gets back in his van and drives away. The red light changes color, and I do the same.

I hope they weren't fighting over who was going to get the last ""Happy Meal""........could gave called this thread.......""Floridamen invade Kanaduh"".........",2021
post-6895013,Young Kim,"Mar 1, 2021 at 2:42 AM","On Saturday night at 3:30 am, I had a pickup in Skokie, IL (a north suburb) by AMC Theaters also near Red Robin and Buffalo Wild Wings. I swiped right, and saw the three young men entering my Uber were going to the Hyatt Place in Rosemont, IL, about a 13 minute ride. Immediately I noticed they were drunk, but even more vexing...very loud. They began to ask me many questions, about everything. I answered abruptly with monosyllables. They were loud... ugh. Then, one of them got on their phone and put it on speaker and called some girl. Then they all proceeded to have a group discussion of their night, also asking me questions to try to involve me in their drunken talk. 

It was the end of a long Saturday night, which are always very taxing for an Uber ant. Especially now during the pandemic, it has gotten so very much worse. So I was not in a mood to feign interest with 3 very loud annoying pax who was discussing their hard partying with some girl they all knew. I could hear them talk stuff like, ""Yeah, when we sat down on the table and that other group approached I was pissed..."", ""Don't you think that the promoter will be interested in holding that party for next weekend?""...stuff like that.

So, I put on my Sony ""almost"" noise cancelling headphones (with very snug earbuds), and turned on some peaceful classical music at a loud volume. I told them that I need to listen to the Uber navigation system to insure that I drive to their destination properly, so I may not be able to communicate with them. Suddenly, as the soft notes of the symphony emerged, the three annoying pax almost seemed to magically disappear from my car. I could hear them still trying to talk to me, gesturing at me, and one even tapped my shoulder trying to get my attention.

I did remove one earbud and asked, ""Is there a problem?"", and he answered, ""No, I just wanna ask you how...(this and that)"". I interrupted with, ""So sorry, but I need to hear the Uber navigation. It is very important."" And then put back on my classical music... 

Soooo nice. It was suddenly like I was in another world of peace and harmony.

I think they got the message, because at the end of the ride, they just got out without saying a word, and I did not say ""goodnight"" either. I recommend everyone get a pair of very snug blutooth headphones (preferably noise cancelling), which will drown out annoying pax. I am doing this more and more now, with great results.

The only issue of course is that you won't be able to hear other traffic, like someone honking their horn. And most importantly, you must redouble your sight for any emergency vehicles since you won't be able to hear sirens. But....I think that at least for me, it is totally worth it. When an annoying pax is about to test my patience, some Mozart, Beethoven, or Handel will help me immensely.

For myself, I care nothing at all about getting a one star review from the pax if they feel I am ignoring them. If they are loud and obnoxious, I put them on ignore... with great satisfaction and relief.",2021

Clinton also refused to answer my calls or text messages.

post-6895041,Young Kim,"Mar 1, 2021 at 3:20 AM","Saturday night February 27th was a very unique evening in the sense that I nearly hit one pedestrian, and had to brake rather hard for another (but I saw the latter coming easily). Also, I very regrettably sent a bunny into rabbit heaven. It was strange because I do sometimes have to narrowly avoid clueless pedestrians, but this all happened within a short span of time in one night. The first was the most jarring, because I nearly (without exaggeration) came very close to striking a pax darting out from between two cars into another Uber. (I do just wish to point out that I was not speeding at all, and rather driving about 3-4 miles under the speed limit). 

I was driving southbound on Linder Ave approaching Lawrence Ave in the north side of Chicago, and on a narrow street, when a would be pax literally jumped out from between two cars and ran in front of my car to their Uber across the street. I hit the brake and gasped at how close I came to hitting him/her. After stopping, I saw the other Uber ant's face who was parked look at me ...and we both shook our heads in disbelief. His pax, in a white parka jacket, with fur on the hoodie so I could not see the face, jumped into the Uber, completely not even acknowledging that he/she (I could not tell) almost got seriously injured. The street was 30 mph, so if I did not brake hard, I doubt the pax would have had life threatening injuries, but he/she would have been gravely hurt.

How many of you have had a person sprint in front of your vehicle running for their own Uber?

Next I was driving west on Harrison Street by Halsted next to the UIC campusk a short while later, and I saw a bunny suddenly jump into the street in a hurry. I slammed on the brakes (I was doing an UberEats order so there was no pax in my car), and veered right fast. As the car decelerated quickly, I thought I cleared the bunny easily......but...it jumped back right into my path under my tires in the last split second!

Squirrels (very common) I have avoided easily because they move in a predictable trajectory, and at constant velocity and zero acceleration. Deer are easy to avoid because they are large and move slowly. Geese or birds are even easier because they move either very very slowly or just fly away. But this bunny was moving and darting all over the place! As it jumped into my path, it hopped like up, left, down, and then finally back to my right...just as I thought I missed it. I heard a thud... I felt awful and disgusted, then hoped that it was not the bunny.

I slowly backed up away left from center...but I saw the heap of rabbit lying in the road. I am not sure why that bothered me so much, but I felt really awful. But not guilty. Because I knew that I did everything I could to avoid that bunny. Plus I was as I always am paying close attention to animals. And I was not speeding at all. It was the very first time in my life I hit a bunny, and noted that I could not have predicted its movement, as it seemed in retrospect completely random and unpredictable. Its last jump was right into my tire paths...sigh.

And so surprisingly (because it happened again shortly later), my next pax pickup was further south in the south side of Chicago by Roosevelt Ave and Racine Ave (a rather faster moving bigger street, 35 mph) I saw a man just run across the street in front of my car. However, I saw him running from the sidewalk easily, as his path was not obscured by cars like the first pedestrian I mentioned who appeared suddenly in between two parked cars. I ended up braking hard though, and he slowly just walked in front of my car as I came to a complete stop. I was a bit unhappy that some people just run into the street (even on a busy street) without looking at ALL. 

I am certain that all Uber ants have come close to hitting clueless pedestrians and likely causing roadkill of animals through no fault of their own. But have any of you actually HIT a pedestrian? Please do share your story of near misses...",2021

post-6879123,Young Kim,"Feb 23, 2021 at 5:09 AM","OK, just when I thought this job cannot get any worse... it did, tonight, a couple of hours ago. I would like to ask at the end if anyone has had a most frustrating pax than the one I just had. The pax was a long pickup in Des Plaines, IL. The name on the app was Jordan. (this is in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, IL, in a middle class suburb). Pax came out of a nice apartment complex. The pax comes out, and everything starts off OK. But then he asks me, ""Do you have an aux cord?"" (Warning to newbies, never ever offer an aux cord if asked, pax will demand you play their music at full blast on repeat the entire ride). I said no of course. Then he asks if he can Blutooth his phone to my car speaker system. I replied of course, ""No, sir, my blutooth system does not work.""

Jordan tells me that he wishes to have me listen to his and his friend, ""Kuta Magnificent""'s recent hip hop song (which he argued would be the single top most downloaded song on Spotify, predicting at least a BILLION downloads... I said, ""so sorry Jordan, but my blutooth system does not work, but if you tell me the song, I'll look it up after I get home tonight, OK?"" Jordan just gets his phone out and starts playing his and his friend's song....... , but the song title was ... (that's right, that  was the name of the song)

I could not believe the garbage that came out of his phone... Mind you, I enjoy all music, including hip-hop and rap music. But his song, ""In the Shit"", was 5 minutes of a guy singing, ""He is in the shit."", ""Bweetch (you all know the actual word) is in the shit"", ""My boy is in the shit"", ""(the N-word) is in the shit"", ""My homie is in the shit"" interspersed with all manner of profanity and vulgar language describing criminal behavior (like shooting drugs, defaming women, committing crimes, etc). I heard the song 4 times in the 20 minute ride... I had to bear hearing some guy rapping the words, "" probably more than two hundred times. I tried to be polite... but I could feel my remaining feelings of positivity towards pax being wiped away, like a vestigial organ or decaying body part.

He asked me to be friends on Facebook and Instagram over and over. I replied, ""Sorry, Uber community guidelines prohibit such communication"". Then at the end of the ride, he asked me AGAIN if I could look him up on Instagram and download and listen AGAIN to his fabulous song, ""In the Shit"", and tell all my friends about it. He said he and his friend, ""Kuta Magnificent"" would become big, as big as Drake, Lil' Wayne, Jay-Z, and The Weeknd. Now, I really enjoy much of the work of the previous artists... But his song, ""In the Shit""... was literally the worst piece of hip-hop I have ever heard.

I already had a stacked order right behind this ride, and so I told Jordan that I cannot stop and look up and download his song, ""In the Shit"". I showed him on my app the green dot after his ride proving that I indeed had another rider who had been waiting a very long time. I told him that the next rider is already waiting 20 minutes, and therefore I could not take any more time since the ride was over. At the end of the ride when we reached the destination, I swiped right and asked very politely if he would exit the vehicle since the next rider had been waiting.

Then he got upset and really bizarre...

Jordan said his real name was ""Kuta Amazing"", not ""Jordan"" (so I really don't know his real name now). He kept insisting...then ... that I look up and download his song, and spread the ""incredible"" work of art of his and his friend's to my friends and my social media connections. When I said I cannot right then but I will do so after my shift was over, he started calling me a ""dumb Asian boy"" over and over...like 20 times! He said I was missing out on letting others know how great his song, ""In the Shit"" was.

I steadfastly insisted that he exit my vehicle, he just refused over and over...and just sat there. He argued that the next passenger does not have a song as great as his, so I would be justified in making the next passenger wait. I replied that it is unlikely that the next pax is even a hip-hop singer. Also, I tried to explain to him that it was very inconsiderate to make someone wait for such an endeavor.

Then he got quiet... and I started to feel a bit nervous. Maybe 45 seconds passed of silence, and I contemplated calling for help (through the Uber app or 911). But this was a moment to try to prevent any escalation. I was in a safe middle class neighborhood in Illinois after all. And he was not being immediately threatening... Rather, he was simply refusing to exit the vehicle and seemed insulted that I would not download his song then and there.

I tried to say encouraging things, positive things, to make him feel better and have him exit the vehicle. Finally, a car approached from behind us, and I told him that I must insist that he exit the vehicle immediately. As I drove forward to allow the car behind me to pass, he  opened the car door put his feet out as his legs dragged across the cement and yelled, ""Bweetch, why are you moving the f'ing car?!""... (I immediately thought to myself, ""WHY ARE YOU OPENING THE CAR DOOR AND TRYING TO STEP OUT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING??!) I was stunned...he could have seriously injured himself.

I stopped fast to avoid him being dragged under my wheels. When the car stopped he finally got out... Never was I more happy that a ride had ended. Strangely, he waved bye to me and smiled!

Since the pandemic began, this job has gotten more and more challenging as the months have passed (I have driven without interruption all months of the past year). To those of you sitting this out during the pandemic, it is likely a very wise decision. I think my sanity is slowly withering away. I think I may start posting like  or maybe far far worse soon if this constant march of negativity does not destroy the final fragments of love and faith I have left for humanity... As I drove off, I literally thought I was dreaming...having a terrible nightmare. Like I really could not believe I had such a crazy passenger... I reflect now that maybe he was high on Crystal Meth or Crack Cocaine...

(Below I will upload a one minute video YouTube link of ""Jordan"" or maybe his name is actually ""Kuta Amazing"" at the end of the ride as he refused to exit my vehicle. You can hear at least one instance of him calling me ... he called me that at least 20 times at the end of the trip, just because I refused to sit and download onto my phone his magnum opus, ""In the Shit"". I can see that upon listening to the audio that I am talking rather fast, normally I do not. But I was very agitated on trying to have him exit my vehicle ASAP. Also, I did not take video footage of his face...)


At this point I am sure everyone knows that I really try my best to be as patient, compassionate, and caring as a person should while driving Uber. But after this ride...... I can see how people can lose their sanity. I am hoping  does not have to read a post of mine in the future where I demonstrate an unbridled hatred of humans. I cannot allow myself to go there.

Finally, I wish to state unequivocally that I was NOT exaggerating the utter sheer insanity of this pax and the aspects of this ride...this all really happened! Before anyone questions why I did not yell and scream at the passenger to ""Get the F out of my car!"", you had to see him and how bizarre he was acting at the end. I thought it best to not agitate him.",2021

With that attitude I said I checked, its not here, sorry. Good Bye and hung up. She tried calling me back 4 more times. I get a call from another number, I don't answer. They leave a message. It is the husband, he tells me he knows the wallet was in his right hand when he got in my car (he got in the driver side rear door) and he put the wallet in the middle of the seat to answer his phone and forgot to grab the wallet when he got out.

I text back that there was no wallet in my car or if he did leave it one of my next PAX must have seen and took it. 

20 minutes later I get a 1 ⭐ rating pop up. Oh well, don't really care about the rating. This morning I realize his story was detailed enough that it should show in my dash cam. You can clearly see him walking up to my car with empty hands. You can see him get in the car and his right hand is clearly empty. You can see him answer his phone and never have a wallet or put it down.

I texted him back this morning saying I reviewed my dashcam files and he did not have a wallet in his hand when we walked up to my car and when he got in my car he clearly did not have any thing in his right hand. Thanks, for the 1 ⭐ rating and no tip.

He never replied back.",2021

Picked up two riders that after the first minute asked ""Can you put something less white on?!"" I was listening to WXPN, an indie station. 

They then had me stop at a wawa, leaving some bags inside the car and took 15 minutes doing whatever they were doing.

On the further journey they gave me a hard time about taking jobs from their people (they heard from my accent I am not American) and I told them that some nights I am driving 9+ miles to pick up and that most drivers simply will not work the hours when I do.

Dropped them off after their 1 hour ride to NJ.

post-6874171,Young Kim,"Feb 21, 2021 at 6:01 AM","All these long hours trying in vain to keep positive are weighing me down... and I can sense darker feelings coming over me. Around 2:00 am, I had a pickup at a bar in the northwest suburbs of Chicago in Arlington Heights. After the pax made me wait (I remember her name was Patricia) for 3 minutes, I saw her come out in a group of 4. I rolled down my window and said, ""Sorry, but there is too many people"". 

She was clearly drunk, and her face was red. She just stared with glassy eyes for a short while silently, and then said, ""Well, can you still take me and my friends home?"" 

I said, ""Sorry, too many people"". (I have a cooler and a bunch of stuff in my front passenger seat)

She replied, ""Can't you move the stuff to the trunk?"" ""I'll tip you"".

I replied to her that I could even though it is against Uber policy... but it may be easier for her to order a second Uber...

At this point, she acted all entitled... and she said angrily, ""What is wrong with you?!"" ""Are you OK?"" ""Are you OK to take us home??!""

I felt something in me snap... (I thought to myself ""obviously why the heck would I not be OK? it is you that is not OK because you are an angry drunk!"")

I abruptly said to her, :""Hey! I'm cancelling this ride! I did nothing wrong here, and suddenly you are being rude to me. I don't take rude customers"". She just stared at me in shock and disbelief... but then I think it dawned on her that she made a mistake. 

I felt such a joy cancelling on her. She did not think this through. Tonight, the wait times, especially in the suburbs, were LONG. Like 15-20 minutes long. And...people were telling me that Ubers were cancelling on them. And the bar she was at with her friends was closing. And, some pax were telling me that they saw the dreaded, ""Sorry no UberX's in your area, pls try again later"" in the northwest suburbs where I was driving. She may have to wait for 15-20 minutes (or longer), and would have to beg the bar to let her and her friends stay inside until another Uber shows up.

Drunk entitled pax often act in a manner that is completely illogical and detrimental. She probably thought in her drunken state that she could be rude and order the Uber drivers to do whatever she wanted. 

Big mistake... this was not pre-Covd in the middle of downtown Chicago. Her friends who were sober knew instantly the mistake Patricia made, and apologized and asked if I would bring them anyway. 

I said, ""No."" I knew also that once the ride started, she would complain and give me crap the entire ride, and obviously one star me (which I don't care about), but I didn't want to deal with an angry drunk pax INSIDE my car. I found that if the pax before the ride even starts, sniffs of a problem, it is better to cut your losses... and get out of there.",2021

post-6874185,Young Kim,"Feb 21, 2021 at 6:22 AM","This was an interesting ride in the sense that it echoes more or more of what I am experiencing with pax. I picked up a couple of young men in the southwest suburbs of Chicago (Western Springs), and brought them all the way up to the north side of Chicago. In this long ride, I had a lot of time to talk to them. Both were out of school now and wanted to become YouTube, TikTok, Instagram stars. They wanted to make it as recording artists...across social media. They told me that they do livestream feeds where people tune into their work, and as I understood it they mix music, like hip-hop.

Where it became more interesting to me was that they gave up looking for a stable job because the price of Bitcoin was soaring so much, that they felt they will never have to work a real job again for the rest of their lives. I did check after the ride ended, and I just saw it hit around $57,000 per Bitcoin. I feel like the pandemic low last year was around $5,000. They kept telling me that I should invest heavily in it... they spoke of it almost as if it was a new religion. They were talking one million dollars per Bitcoin...and stuff like that.

I heard that Uber may accept Bitcoin as payment...or some rumors of that?

I wished them well, and for their sake I hope that they achieve their dreams. But I wondered to myself if this is the right attitude? Can a plethora of young college age/college graduates decide and become successful cryptocurrency investors... and not have to work any real jobs? 

I am not sure if such an attitude is best. I do own some Bitcoin actually, and I don't recommend it or not recommend it here...but I wanted to share an interesting story about how many young people are banking on the price of it to allow them never to do 9-5 again. I am not so sure if that is a good plan. Even if it works, our economy will still need people to work right?",2021

We hit it off at the start of the 30 minute ride, and it turns out she was in charge of take out and deliveries at this large place on the VD weekend. Decided to interview her on the sly for some UP content........heh.

They turned off all internet delivery apps after the first 2 hours (around 600 PM) because they were getting slammed on all fronts (DD, UE, and STD) and could not handle it. Mainy the apps though were causing the trouble. Too many people ordering and no kitchen can keep up, too many customers complaining, losing 30% in fees and having things sit an hour plus for pickups was the reason. As these are the least profitable orders by far, they got whacked.

Next was pick ups for take out from their own website, which were averaging about 3-5 orders every 15 minutes for about 3 hours straight. They track this metric in 15 minute segments apparently, and promote it with discounts and a points program for members.

They also had a 90 minute line to be seated until close, as they were not doing reservations. Covid here means you can only seat 50% capacity, so, they were being ruthless and doing first come first serve with a 90 min max seating time. Can't say I blame them.",2021

post-6830423,Young Kim,"Feb 5, 2021 at 5:43 AM","It started off fine... I picked up 2 pax at a bar in a suburb south of the city around 3:00 am. It was a couple. The guy suddenly started asking me if I was Korean. I replied, ""Yes, sir, I am"". He proceeded to ask me 27 times exactly if I was Korean on a 17 minute ride. Each time, I would answer ""Yes."" After around the 20th time, I started counting it back to him. ""Yes, I am Korean, that is for the 22nd time""...""Yes, I am Korean, for the 23rd time""...""Yes, I am Korean, for the 24th time"" etc. At this point, I went from being annoyed to very amused...

The girlfriend (who was very cute), started to apologize profusely and kept telling her boyfriend to shut up. She was quite friendly and tried to divert the repeated questions to other topics. She asked me if I thought she was fit and cute, showed me her stomach, to which I replied, ""Of course!...""haven't you seen a mirror recently?""

Then... the boyfriend suddenly started asking me, "" ...are you Korean?"" over and over...

I calmly replied that both my parents are Korean, so my genetics followed from that biological fact... He in his drunken state, started to repeat that same question over and over... afraid to get to the 27th time for that question, I cut him off... I then answered by having a short talk about how there are 46 chromosomes in each cell of my body... consisting of 22 pairs, and two sex chromosomes...inheritance patterns, etc. And all this explains why my being Korean has a logical connection to my parents being Korean.

For my own amusement, I quickly pointed out how traits are inherited from each parent through DNA transmission according to Mendelian genetics... and again tried to explain that is the reason I am in fact Korean and not another race...

After a long silent pause... he again asked...""So...why are you Korean?""

I tried so hard not to laugh...

At the end of the ride, the girlfriend apologized again for her boyfriend, and then handed me a twenty. The boyfriend gets out, and is suddenly very friendly with me, and asked his girlfriend if she had tipped me well. She replied that she did and both disappeared into their apartment building.

post-6866139,#1husler,"Feb 18, 2021 at 11:34 AM","I have mixed feeling about pax, the same as I would about any John and Jane Doe with whom I'd have to interact with out there, I guess.

But there is one variety of pax who I appreciate more than most...its the pax who unknowingly ""aids and abets"" me to weed out their low paying/potentially problematic rides by ""outing"" themselves with messages which reveal the ""true colors"" of what might transpire if I dare PU at their ""pin drop"".

Upon receipt of such messages I quickly cancel, then re-cast my net for higher paying rides/lower drama rides, saving me the hassle of having to haul it 5 mins down the road, only to see a nonsensical ride that I can't work with.

This is a thank you to them, because they keep my economic fly wheel turning, without having to break my vibe or mess up my bottom line.

The pax who sends these revealing message is indeed a special one...because unlike their stealthier counterparts (who KNOW what they/their rides are so mask their true location and/or identity or continually launch new accounts, to woo drivers back into their den), they volunteerily ""tip their hand"" to show me the kinda of ride most likely to suck time, money and energy out of my hustle, possibility ending my hustle on a sour note.

These message are super helpful in my market where U/L don't show pax destination (until you accept all the +25 min away rides and ""score"" a 95% AR or something like, which I DONT have)....one can sniff out rides which don't make financial sense by simply reading and understanding these pax messages.

Here are a few of my ""choice"" favorites, with interpretations:

Pax message: ""We are at the Circle K"" [and its 1am... just scored and need a mule, bruh!]

Pax message: ""I have a lot of groceries"" [so can you load our 2 carts full, drive .75 miles, park your nice new car in section 8 housing after dark and leave it unattended to run my stuff up 4 flights of stairs for $2.25 and..ooh, don't worry because I'll take care of you on the app]

The best one is...

Pax message: ""You are picking my son up from middle school school"" [thus violating your ToS on a ride which is not only awkward but not completely legal, and can result in legal action].

By the way...this message is a good one to screen shot, and then dash to U/L, inviting them to discuss ToS with pax.

Are there any pax messages you all get which prompt a quick cancellation?",2021

""You are supposed to pick up at the back door. It says so in the app"", with a ""yuck, delivery guy"" attitude.

Okay I know chances are real slim that Juan will ever read this.

Yesterday around 6:00 PM I get a ping for a trip 35 miles south, estimated to be 45 minutes long. I pull up and there are 3 ladies, mom and and two teens estimated in the 16-17 year old range. I verify identity and they all pile in the back seat. I know this trip is going to an area that is farther away from my house and chances of getting a ride back to my area will be slim but oh well.

Mom immediately gets on the phone and says we are in a second Uber and should be there in less than an hour. My mind starts to wonder??? Several minutes later Mom gets on the phone again, and I hear here say ride issue, okay she is on the phone with Uber support. After some frustration she gets connected to a person.

Basically, Juan in a red Toyota Sienna came to pick them up. After they were in the car he started the trip and saw where they are going. Guessing Juan does not have Uber Pro Status. She said Juan proceeded to demand a $35 cash tip up front because he would have to drive back 35 miles with no pay. She refused, Juan kicked them out and drove off.

She was going off on the Uber rep on the phone, she also had to repeat twice to the rep ""No not Paul I am in his car now and we are heading to our hotel"", it was Juan that was the problem.

Juan demanded $35.00, kicked out his PAX and his PAX rewarded me with a nice crisp $50.00 bill upon arrival to their resort. She thanked me for a nice safe professional ride.

On a side note I did several trips in that area while I was there and also my final trip in that area took me 14 miles back toward my house. Well worth the slight inconvenience of going 35 miles away from home.",2021

In september I officially did my last Uber ride and although it had many ups downs I’m thankful for Uber because at a time of need when I need some extra income I was able to just do that. Uber is a terrible company to work for and after a while it does wear on you and I truly lasted as long as I could, after working a regular 9-5 I would put in 15 to 30 hours a week on Uber and did this for almost 2 years. September of 2020, I finally had enough I was working 7 days a week some days 14 hours a day between both jobs and I just needed a break.
In December i decided to give the stock market I try, my first month was a complete bust I lost about $1200 of my original $5,000 investment and completely took out all my investments.

Normally I have my calls screened so that if the number is not in my contact list it goes straight to voice mail, but I happened to have that switched that off because I was making some banking calls earlier in the day. I had a PAX in the car at the time so at first I ignored it, but then the call came again. So against my better judgement I answered. I am paraphrasing here a little bit but the person on the line said he was calling from Uber support and that since I was a stellar driver Uber was going to give me $500. I told him I had a fare and he said he would call back. 10 minutes later he did. He repeated his claim that he was going to give me $500. I parked the car and he proceeded to give my instructions on how to claim my cash. This involved changing the listed phone number in the app to one I did not know and then adding a debit card number to my cash out list. I went along with what he told me to do, but all the time I kept thinking something is not right. Before he could finish the process I hung up on him and tried to call Uber support. But of course it was in the evening and they are closed until Monday. Al the time the number came up again several times and then I got a text stating to call him back when I was ready to finish verification for my money. I am not going to do anything until I can verify this guy is who he says he is by calling Uber support Monday when they are open.

Was this a scam?? I don't know. But there is an old saying. ""When something seems to be to good to be true, it probably is."" Also, if you get a phone call in the middle of the night with a person wanting to give you money, alarm bells should be ringing.

I am pretty sure I almost lost a weeks worth of pay by cashing out to a strange debit card number. I am glad I wised up in time.

post-6830409,Young Kim,"Feb 5, 2021 at 5:23 AM","Several days ago when it snowed in Chicago (I think it was 8 inches), I was doing my shift overnight and saw at least 10-12 cars get stuck in the snow during my overnight shift. I am reminded of this as it is snowing hard right now on my night shfit. Cars would be turning from the main street into a side street that was unplowed... and would get stuck immediately. I am reminded of seeing roaches simply walking into a roach motel as a kid. It was so sad. I carried a shovel with me in the car, because I knew what would happen. 

I was able to save a few people by helping them dig out in between deliveries and pickups. But I definitely could not save all of them. When I did have one pax in my Uber, another car did swerve in front of me and almost hit us and slid backwards into a ditch. It was probably just a few feet away. I was driving so slowly so I was able to avoid him/her. It was the first BIG snowfall in Chicago in many years, so I suppose that people were not used to it. 

It was really sobering to see all the stuck cars. I myself only stuck to the main roads which were well plowed, and avoided any side streets which were not well plowed... Wait times I heard from pax were over an hour around 3:00 am. I was in a far suburb. When I picked some of them up, they were really grateful that someone was still out to get them. One guy actually said (his exact words, ""Sir, you are like an angel that God sent to me tonight.""

post-6819651,JohnJames8678,"Jan 31, 2021 at 7:56 PM","*Disclaimer* I’ve written a couple lighthearted dumb posts on this forum, but this story is more serious and dark. I don’t know if it’s even appropriate to . It involves someone who passed away from a drug overdose and it might be triggering to some. I mean no harm to the family or anyone who has lost someone to drugs or mental health. Please seek help if you or someone you know is thinking about hurting themselves.

This story happened about 6 years ago in San Francisco. It was a chilly night with no fog and a stiff breeze. It’s about 1am that night, I think it was like a Tuesday or something. Basically dead on the ride front. Anyways, as I’m sitting waiting for a ping I notice a guy in a nice suite slumped over on the corner of the sidewalk. People were passing by, and just stepping over him. Being in San Francisco there is homeless people and drug use everywhere so people are immune to this kind of stuff, but something was off. He had a suite on and looked different from the everyday bum. I told myself “don’t worry about it he’s just drunk” I was telling myself not to go over and check, but I’m looking at this dude not move and looking stone cold dead so I decided to get out of my car and go investigate. Well, turns out he’s alive, barely. I shake him awake and he’s moving and grumbling some nonsense. I call 911, which in San Francisco isn’t very useful. The operator on the line is asking me “sir is he breathing”. I’m trying to convey to her that he’s moving, but I think he’s just drunk or something. She says something that would ultimately cost him his life. She asked me “Sir do you want us to send an ambulance? We get a lot of these calls and if he seems ok maybe you can take him to a hospital if it’s safe for you” I was a bit surprised by that response. I was just asked to put him in my Lyft and drive him to the hospital. I end up rolling him over, he’s younger maybe 34, a good looking and clean cut Asian dude. I carry him to my car and sit him upright. He’s fumbling over, but I manage to strap him in my back seat. I start driving him to the nearest hospital ER. While we are driving I’m asking what his parents number is so I can let them know he’s in the hospital. He hands me his phone and after not unlocking it I’m forced to use his finger print to unlock it. I get in his phone and it’s all in a different language. I find a number he last texted in I message and copy it into my phone. I finish driving him to the hospital. I turn around and look at him and he’s dead. Like straight up eyes rolled back, dead. I run in to the ER heart pounding out of my chest thinking Jesus Christ I have a dead man in my car. The ER lady at the front desk hits the emergency button and a team of people rush out with a gurney and load him out of my car and wheel him into the ER. I don’t know what to text to the number, who it is or what I should say. I ended up saying “I found a man, and took him to the hospital, found your number in his phone” said my name and the hospital he was at and that was that. I get a call back a week later. It’s the person I texted. The man tells me the guy passed away from a drug overdose and mentioned he was his boyfriend and that the guy was depressed because he had just lost his law license and had a drug problem and they had just broken up. The boyfriend cried, but seemed almost relieved mentioning he had been a major burden on people. Like dang dude, he just died and your still gonna talk bad about him. Definitely a bad break up. It got weird after he offered to have my girlfriend and I have dinner at his restaurant for free for trying to save of his ex. He said this after he finished crying on the phone as I told him about the guys last moments. Anyways, this still haunts me to this day. Always get the ambulance if your unsure don’t let 911 convince you otherwise.

post-6809629,#1husler,"Jan 27, 2021 at 7:47 PM","So, this isnt so much a ""story"" as it is an observation....that RS drivers' ability to bargain for more equitable terms/treatment is disabled by all the ""hobby drivers"", who aren't grinding it to make rent, but just do RS to get out of the house for a Dunkin Donuts run (score some decaf and a danish) and then what the heck, pick of a pax or two, maybe a few, then head back home for a visit from the grandkids.

Are you a hobby driver? Do you know who these guys are? Well...

I recently relocated to Tucson (sun-bird central), but still fly now and again for work, so (of course) use RS...the drivers picking me during day hours (not night) are kindly retired ""old-timers"" who drive all leisurely and seem oblvious to what they might make (or not make) per ride.

An example.

Me: Hey, I also do RS, hows it been going for you in Tucson?

Ernie: Oh, you know, I dont know, I just do it now and again, get a break from the mrs, its good to get out of that place at least one day and see whats going on out here, hehehe.

Me: Oh cool, ok, good to make some money too. Are there rides you tend to prefer or avoid?

Ernie. Nope. I just drive whatever, I go where-ever, pick up anyone.

Me: Whoa, thats different, because...for example, I avoid Walmart, I dont make enough money on those, having to load and off load 2 carts of groceries.

Ernie. Ohhhhhh I dont mind those, but I cant get out to help, because of my back and my knees.

Me: But...the wait, like, they only pay us 6 cents a min? Mann, I cant work for that, can you?

Ernie: Is that what they pay? I didnt even know...how much do they pay per mile? I dont much pay attention to these thing you know, I just drive, need to get out of the house once in a while, but not too long, or wifey might think I have a girlfrend, ahhahha!


I took Ernie's number, he was cool, friendly and I could call him direct for my airport runs, and put 100% of the fare in his pocket, though he probably ""doesnt care"".

I've noticed that pax have going bonkers on the multi-stops and grocery store PUs during the pandemic AND because these rides keep coming and coming, I figure enough drivers are accepting these PUs (otherwise RS would drop them OR offer drivers more money)....I wont touch these PUs, and dash them away... I used to wonder WHO picks up my left-overs.. it seems these hobby drivers happily take them. RS is neat hobby, but drivers who are you hustling it to make rent and pay for college, etc, wont be able to advocate for better pay with all these guys out there.

Haven't been driving much but went out today. Pings have been awful but stacked. AR is perpetually less than 70% because of ridiculous pickup distances and awful ratings (4.43 being one).

Stacked ping in the hood, 4.6x. Declined. Immediately after, 5* in another bad neighborhood (but not as bad, lots of college kids).

Account holder was a woman, I picked up a dude that looked like he's not unfamiliar with corrections. The trip was 98 miles (about an hour and forty minutes), northern Virginia. I didn't see a ""45+ minute trip"" on the ping.

Debated whether or not to take it, my gut said no. As always with these trips, I discussed a tip and we agreed on $20. He said his girlfriend's son was in the hospital.

With 53 minutes left on the trip, his girlfriend called and asked if ""y'all are okay"". I said yes, gave her our ETA. He was asleep.

Five minutes later, on the highway, the trip was canceled.

I woke him up, told him what happened, and said I would drop him off at the next exit. ""No, you'll take me back to where you picked me up!""

Negative &#128514;

He was cool after I explained that I had no idea what happened with his girlfriend and I don't drive for free. He said his phone only works on WiFi and I dropped him off at a McDonald's, about five minutes after the trip was canceled.

post-6816125,Aw Jeez,"Jan 30, 2021 at 10:10 AM","Here in Pensacola, Florida, passengers often ask ""how I did"" during the worst of the pandemic lockdowns and such? They ask it in a concerned tone of voice, as if they assume I've done poorly. But I tell 'em, ""Great!"" The truth is that I did not miss a day of work, *and* I did not see any loss of business. I attribute this to two things:

1) There are plenty of people in my town who *had* to work - those employed by convenience stores and fast-food joints, nursing homes and restaurants...in other words, ""essential"" or exempted businesses. Many of my passengers were from a (ahem) lower-income strata of society and to work. But also, many of them did not have cars and have come to rely on R/S to get to and from work.



2) I assume that a lot of Uber/Lyft drivers are older, and many of them may have ""health issues,"" otherwise, they'd all probably have regular jobs. My thinking goes that because many(?) R/S drivers fall into one or more ""at-risk"" category, they stopped driving out of, as they say on TV, ""an abundance of caution."" End result: Fewer drivers on the road competing for the rides.

Whatever the actual reasons, I did not have to stop driving nor did I lose any income at all in 2020. I hit all of my admittedly modest daily income targets, and I found that I could achieve them in fewer hours per day than in the pre-pandemic days. Most days, it was non-friggin' -stop...ping-ping-ping. I worked hard all my life; I did not take this ""job"" so I could work hard some more.. Sometimes I'd kind of feel guilty about stopping early and ""abandoning"" passengers who needed rides. But after my second beer, those feeling passed.

I know that my experience here in my town was probably not typical, but I hope that all of us who continued to drive through this (wink-wink) ""pandemic"" did as well.",2021

I am only able to drive nights and early mornings for good reasons so my experiences are often 'fun'

So, picked up a pax, black woman who was doing at-home care that kept me waiting for two minutes but she apologized as soon as she got in the car so I thought nothing of it as she seemed nice.

We made our first stop at a gas station nearby that took her 8 minutes, she got in the car and I was driving to her destination when her tone did a 360° flip and she harangued me for following the GPS route which was only 15 seconds and one turn away from the only possible, logical subsequent route.

She was really turning nasty and irrational even as I pointed out the route was the fastest and lowest milage possible of three options on waze & uber nav so I pulled over, cancelled the ride and asked her to leave my car.

She refused, unleashed a further torrent of abuse so for the first time ever after 1500+ rides I called 911 to get her out of my car.

I gave the operator an accurate description of my car with hazards on and a squad car blew right past my vehicle even after me flashing my hibeams.

Two more 911 calls of police fail (gods help me if I am ever being assaulted!) and an hour later another uber arrived and she got out, maskless after calling me among other insults a n word.

I called diamond support with my story, informing them that I had dashcam footage of the whole trip but they said that they could not expunge the 1* she gave me.

I drove to the nearest cop shop and a Sgt stated that no crime was committed as I initially invited her into my car despite me repeatedly telling her to leave.

For example, if I roll up to a bar, club, at night on weekends, I'll make very sure that a pax doesn't look too wasted before I unlock and I let them in my nice car, to lower the chances of them throwing up, getting too belligerent, etc., just being in insufferable pain the butt.

So I have no idea how and why I let my guard last night, but I did.

I rolled into a higher end residential neighbor (not bar or club) for a PU, parked, and was fiddling with my phone, not paying close enough attention to my environment...some how I left the car doors unlocked.

The next thing...I heard the door open, I said hi and introduced myself, then turned my head to see two women straining to hoist this big (6' 2''?), burly semi-conscious drunk into my nice car. ""Oh, hell no, ladies"", I responded, ""seriously, you can't...."", ""thank you...bye...."", they cut me off, then took off, leaving this incoherent drunk, who slouched horizontally across my backseat and went to sleep, even snoring.

I checked the ride and...it was long, like 20+ mins, but most of it on the interstate, and at least it was another residential (not commercial) address so, I could probably get him out the car and to the doorstep, or on his lawn. He was too blasted to be any trouble to me, though he might throw up in route.

I decided the quickest route out of this situation would be to simply, hustle him from point A to point B.

That's what I did.

I gunned it up the 1-10 to cut the time, got him to the address....parked, and woke him up.

He was still too sloshed to talk but...looked slowing around, seemed to recognize his place and pointed at it and grinned.

Ok, great, I helped him out the car, and luckily the 15 min ""cat nap"" revived enough of his motor abilities that he could sorta make a slow zig-zap like walk to his house without my help (I wanted as little end game involvement as possible)...I watched him enter, ended the ride, then got the hell outta there, logged off and went home- No more Friday night drunks!",2021

I am making money hand over fist between Uberx, ubereats, door dash, and Lyft. There are times where I make 30, 40, 50, or even more per hour for just driving around. Every day is like an adventure where you never know where you will end up or who you will meet. It's like playing a video game on your cell phone where your goal is to make as much money as possible. I make way more money than I need at this point it's all about trying to break my personal records of how much money I can make in an hour, a day, or a week. I love all the unexpected big trips and tips that come out of nowhere. I literally cannot help but stumble onto a huge pile of money every time I hit the road.

Around 2:45 am I get a taxi ping..

(insert shit-hole motel name and you get the idea)

party of 1 wheelchair/can transfer

😪

Why did I accept this fare.

Roll up to the hotel and he’s toes to the curb,

who hoo...

He has no legs...

😪


I get out of the car and I smell it
Old guy who doesn’t shower regularly with health problems...




5 excruciating minutes later.... I start to put the wheelchair in the trunk.

I want to go to the Denny’s on lee rd.

“They arnt open late night anymore sir”

“really?”

“yep”

“well let’s go past anyway I want to see for myself”

😐

I drive over and the place is dark... dark enough we don’t have to get out.

“ok can you call the ihop on east colonial and make sure they are open?”

Ok...

find it call in in... they are open!

Ok yeah ihop..

I drive him down to the ihop..

if I buy you breakfast Will you turn the meter off?

(oh look an offer for free food, yeah I ate a. HOUR before)

“Sir that’s a really nice offer but I just ate.

“oh well here you go, keep the change”

“Can you come back at 4;00? I don’t want to pay to have you wait.” (Currently 3:15)


I look at the dispatch computer.. there ain’t shit, it’s 3:15 am and covid is making mornings extra lousy with the lack of people flying.

yeah sure .... (why the hell I said yes to this is a total mystery)

So I arrive back and another 5 minutes to get him loaded:

“Oh shit” I hear in the back.

“Everything ok back there?” I ask afraid to ask.

“I think I’m oozing out of my leg”.

🤢🤮

Not “bleeding” OOZING!

what oozes?

Well any pus filled whatever I don’t want it to think about.

I get him back to the motel and out of the car and there’s a streak across the seat that starts snot green and transitions smoothly into bloody red.

🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

Sorry all I have is another $15.

😪

Fml

I look at the time. 4;30. I start heading for the shop and I see a ping hit.

4T.

it’s accompanied by w fleet wife messfage.

4t going to Mco

so great it’s like a $40 airport fare I’m nearby and can’t take it due to the... pusy bloody mess.

I make it to the shop and top off the tank, my phone goes off.

“Hey Stevie there’s no one else close can you get that airport fare it’s like w $40 fare.

“No... that last guy had some kind of something burst open and it smeared blood and pus on the seat. I’m going back to the shop.


and that’s how my Monday/Tuesday ended,

$340 gross revenue $190 profit...",2021
post-6785267,Stevie The magic Unicorn,"Jan 20, 2021 at 1:28 AM","So I picked up this dude at a bar around midnight.

He wants to make a stop at a liquor store and to get some food.

Ok sir whatever...

Liquor store goes without a hitch we go past a Wendy’s and make a stop at the drive thru...

I immediately hear the sound of rustling drive thru bag and the sound of drunk eating.


Less then 5 minutes later we get to his home and he pays. He’s left a mess, suprise surprise and doesn’t tip much at all.

He stumbles in so I’m in his drive way cleaning up the back seat. Handful of fries (I had the drink in the front cup cup holder because there’s no cup holders in the back seat (a total lie but he was drunk enough to beleive me and I’ve done this 1000 times)

So... low and behold there’s another $20 bill on the back seat.


So I throw HIS fries in his bush in front of his house for the ants to eat.

And I’m laughing all the way to my next fare.


Instant karma?

I mean right?

or should I feel guilty?

I’d take an honest judgement.",2021

post-6775471,MyJessicaLS430,"Jan 16, 2021 at 9:29 PM","What I like about deliveries is that we are informed of the expected pay and trip information without the need of maintaining the 85% AR nonsense. While the way we run our business can differ greatly, it is fair to assume that it only makes sense to accept those with promised tips. 

Contrary to my belief, it looks like there are always drivers who love taking unprofitable offers that we would decline in a split second probably because of the combination of more rookies / desperate drivers / add any plausible causes here. As you may know, Home Depot, Apple and Best Buy deliveries are basically community service (long trip + $0 tip). To test the hypothesis that low-ball offers are never left behind, I have tried bidding a few. Sometimes when I was still reading the details (dimensions, weight, etc), the offer had already expired :eeking:!!

Can there be a possibility that I may have missed something? According to my experience, never expect a dime of tip if a customer does not offer any upfront although there can be miracles. One time I was tipped $30 cash for delivering 2 large bottles of bleach and a microwave oven. Does the vast majority of our fellow drivers accept what are made available? Every time seeing a ridiculous offer gets accepted in no time, I cannot help but shaking my head.",2021

post-6754899,Cvillegordo,"Jan 10, 2021 at 10:10 AM","I have a regular pax that I have driven to/from her work as well as a few other places over the past year. She lives in the housing projects, she is quiet and polite - most of the time. On a couple occasions I drove her together with a friend, and she was a different person; snippy and somewhat rude. Since I encounter other snippy and rude pax, this didn't really bother me. However, two incidents made this a problem. About a week ago I got a ping to pick her up a few blocks from her home. The address is a location where there have been a half dozen shootings in the past month, also public housing. I stopped on the street and carefully monitored my surroundings including the large parking lot of front of the apartment buildings that I assumed the pax would come from. I waited about two minutes and a young man approached across the grass, said ""Lyft?"" I answered ""No."" and got this in reply; ""Then get your b.it.ch as.s out the street."" I immediately obliged and left, canceled and got the fee. I got an immediate phone call from the pax; I told her what happened and she screamed; ""That's my brother!"" Too bad. 

This past Saturday night, I got a ping to pick her up at her workplace. When I arrived, after a couple minutes four young people, two girls and two boys (my regular was not one of them) came running out, laughing, all carrying several large bags from the closed store. I suspected they had just enjoyed a private no-charge shopping spree, but I'm not going to judge. They surrounded the car and began yelling, talking excitedly and yanking on my door handles. Only one was wearing a mask. I called out; ""Sorry! Maximum three passengers. Masks required."" This resulted in an immediate chorus of vociferous verbal abuse. (Flashback to a couple hundred traffic stops.) One maskless young man approached my door and pressed his body against my partially open window and proceeded to give me some serious hood eyes and attitude. I repeated the rules, realizing that he was very close to attacking me, called out ""Watch your feet!"" and pulled away quickly. As I did he threw a handful of something in my face, most bounced off the window but a couple hit me. (Throwing a ""missile"" at a moving car in Virginia is a felony.) The ""missiles"" turned out to be French fries, but I have gotten this offense charged before for rocks, gravel, a book, a bunch of keys, and an apple to name a few other ""missiles."" 

I went around the corner, canceled and got the fee. Called support, described the incident, they escalated to another team immediately and I described everything again to a very articulate, intelligent sounding support rep. Within half an hour I got an email saying that I would not be matched to this person again, and then a bit later another email adding that she had been banned from the platform. Satisfying, but I wonder how long that ban will last? Also, since I have taken several other pax to/ from this girl's workplace, chances are good that I'll see her again. That will be interesting. The most annoying part of this to me is that in spite of two dangerous incidents involving residents of the same housing projects, and in spite of multiple shootings in that location recently, I'm guessing that if a pax complains that I would not pick them up because of their race, I'll get deactivated. Do me a favor I suppose, but I do enjoy having this part time gig available. My cancelation rate is going to continue to climb",2021

Yesterday I did my first airport run and as usual I turned on last ride before I got there as I don't want a rematch if there is no surge. I dropped off the PAX and see that there is a $14 surge. I go to turn ride requests back on and get the message there is a problem with your account.

Open it up and have to agree to a background check, do that and it gives me suggestions to read wile I wait.

Can't go online and score a surge ride. Oh well I head home. I start thinking about the posts I read here about how it took weeks to get back online. I was getting pissed that they did this to me on a Sunday, a good money day.

I got home tinkered around with my boat and decided to check the app. Surprise, I was able to go back online. Wish they would have send me a notification of some kind.

post-6776033,Young Kim,"Jan 17, 2021 at 2:27 AM","So I was in the west side of Chicago which is a relatively dangerous area doing an Uber Eats order for a burger king. (The delivery just completed at 1:27 a.m.) When I made the delivery the lady came down and said could you please deliver it to some other address. So I told her let me GPS it and find out where it was. She gave me an address that was about 7 minutes away by cicero and Chicago avenue.

Since the delivery address could not be changed on the app she suggested that she could pay me in cash. I agreed because there was no real way to change it through the app anymore. When I asked her how much should be willing to pay she surprised me and said $30! I seriously thought she was just going to offer $5 because it wasn't very far.

So she pulled out a $20 bill and 10 singles and just handed it to me and said *you look like someone I can trust.""

so I just exchanged phone numbers with her so that I could contact her when I got to the delivery location so her friend could come down and retrieve the food. The delivery went without a hitch and she took me even tipped me more on the app afterward!

This was quite a surprise so I just wanted to share this. I was surprised that somebody would be so willing to trust someone after the delivery was complete ...and also offer such a enormous amount of money for such a short distance.

She was upset because most all her co-workers decided to take the unemployment but for whatever reason that I couldn't figure out, she did not get it herself. She said her manager was quite upset because he couldn't get enough workers. And she was not happy that she picked up all these extra hours that she really didn't want because her manager asked her .......that someone HAD to do those hours.

She was also upset at us Uber drivers as well... She doesn't drive and she uses Uber exclusively to get to work and from work back to home. These days she has to wait up to 30 minutes to get an Uber, so to be safe she plans one full hour earlier for her commute.

I tried to defend all the workers on UI because maybe they all either need a vacation and/or are scared of the virus.

post-6733063,Young Kim,"Jan 4, 2021 at 5:42 AM","So tonight (Sunday), I went out after tutoring a student in math... and got a ping that was twenty minutes away, by Lake Michigan. I was about to cancel but I got a phone call from the pax. I answered and there was a frantic voice on the other end:

(pax): ""Please save us! We are stuck in the Chicago Botanical Gardens!, and we have a child in a stroller...and we are freezing!""

(me): ""What is going on?!""

She explained that when the Chicago Botanical Gardens closed, she, her boyfriend, and her baby left thinking that they can easily get home. She tried to get an Uber and Lyft, but all cancelled... one after another after another. She had been out in the cold with her boyfriend and child for nearly an hour. She said they were freezing in the cold, and sounded totally desperate. She said her and her boyfriend's phone was about to die, and I was basically the last hope.

They saw some light show at the Botanical Gardens, and the place had closed a while back... I agreed to get them. I drove the twenty minutes from like west of Northfield to the gardens. When I got there, I saw that the entrance road INTO the gardens was closed! I called her and asked her where she was and that I could not get in.

She sounded increasingly frantic, and said there was no one there around them to ask, and it was so dark. I guess all the staff left, and they were all alone. She could not make out anything except that her boyfriend and baby and her were next to a big lit up Christmas tree. I then put my hazards on, and drove around until I saw an open road (but it was an ""exit only"") road. It was one way the wrong way... but I went anyway because it was private property, and there were no other cars anywhere, so I could see if there would be a car driving towards me...(e.g. I drove through one of the exit roads that led OUT of the gardens, and into the park.

I drove around for a bit looking for them, and she stayed on the phone while I drove. I could not see any lit up Christmas tree... The Chicago Botanical Gardens is HUGE, and finding a few people in the dark seemed hopeless. She said she and her boyfriend were getting completely panicked, because the boyfriend's phone was about to die, and hers was as well. I said I would continue to search, and said I would find help.

As I drove around for a while, I finally saw a car in the distance with a man wearing a shirt with those yellow florescent strips on it. I was so happy to see him, as there seemed to be NOBODY else in the park. I think it was around 11:00 pm at night. I drove right up and explained the situation. I put her on and she told him about the surroundings....

He immediately knew where it was, and said he would drive there and have me follow him. So I did...

About a minute later, we both saw them! and the baby stroller...

They ran up shivering. They both thanked me and the man who helped me find them. After getting in, she explained again how she requested and got cancelled on... again, and again, and again.

She said I was like a savior today (like a ER doctor, firefighter, or other rescue worker). She said that without me, they were about to completely panic, as they saw no other way to get home. I drove them about 20 minutes to Rogers Park, IL to their apartment. She told me her life story which was so interesting and full of adventure. She was 25 years old and inexperienced about life. She thanked me over and over again about my not cancelling on her, and how I was so great because I did not give up on her, her boyfriend, and her baby boy. She said that Christ answered her prayers today. She explained that she saw no other way of getting home if it were not for me.

When the ride ended, I showed her and her boyfriend a few magic tricks like this one that I thought the young child would like:

post-6765165,The Gift of Fish,"Jan 13, 2021 at 12:36 PM","A while back I did the Santander Uber lease (I know, I know). A year into the lease the car was totalled by another driver and, because he was underinsured, Uber's insurer at the time (James River) paid me the value of the car.

James River assessed the value of the car at $23,000 and Santander said the payoff amount (or the money still owed to them in the lease contract) was $21,000. James River said that they would send the settlement to Santander, whom they expected to deduct the payoff amount and send me the $2,000 balance.

When I got in touch with Santander to let them know what was happening, they claimed that, since the car belonged to them, they would be keeping the whole settlement from the insurer.

I responded that, although they owned the car, I owned the insurance policy and was the insured and beneficiary of it, not Santander. I told them that a lienholder is entitled to their financial interest in the asset; not a penny more or a penny less. However, Santander insisted that they would take all the money.

I called James River again. The said that Santander's position was highly unusual. They told me the same as I told Santander - I was the insured and was the one entitled to the settlement, less any lien balance due. They agreed to send Santander a check for the payoff amount and a separate check to me. The loss adjuster said that this was the first time he had ever had to do that. 

I phoned Santander to inform them that I had bypassed them, that they'd only be getting the $21,000 and that they should be grateful for it. I never heard from them again.

My question is: has anyone else ever come across such a scam attempt by Santander or other finance house when they have a lien on your car and your car is totalled out by an insurer for more than the payoff amount?",2021

Well...

Yesterday I got ping in Tucson, did the PU only to see that the pax was going to the Arizona/Mexico border at Nogales, about 90 mins down the I-10. He asked me if it was ""ok""?, and I decided I'd go for it, because I had time, its a beautiful drive and a neat place.

On arrival at the border at Nogales, the pax informed me that he wanted to me to drive him across the border into Mexico, and then another 4 hours to Puerto Penasco (Rocky Point), and would pay me $300. It seemed a bad idea for a number of reasons, such as...that road is in very poor condition (a storm washed it away years ago), the wait to re-enter the US is looong, oh and my car isnt insured in Mexico, etc., etc.

When I inquired about this, I was told about a driver in this market, whom she and other drivers apparently know as the notorious ""Lyft Nazi"" (not to be confused with the notorious RBG).

She said that, this driver of infamy will pull up and crack the window just enough to bark out a laundry list of rules and regs (ie, stop where you are and listen, mask on before you approach this car, seat belt on immediately you enter, no food or drinks in the car, my music, my directions, etc, etc), then inform you that if you dont agree ""you can find another ride!, because its my car and you are my guest!"".

She said she and her buddies DONT like the Lyft Nazi, and were always one starring this dude and complaining...but that he's still out there plying our roads....I'd think, he more or less has ""the right"" to state his TOS and pax can consent or not, none of this technically conflicts with Lyft TOS, so he'd be good to go...just that his rating would plummet, but then he'd get deactivated for that too, right?

I had never heard about anything like the Lyft Nazi, yes...I'll remind a pax to dash on a mask, tend to ignore ""music requests"", I'll sorta tolerate and humor persons wanting to ""give me directions"", and whether they buckle up on the backseat or not is not my problem (Im not a kindergarden teacher)...of course, no eating in the car, no no no.

I dont know if the Lyft Nazi reads these forums?, but...Lyft Nazi, are you out there? Can you tell us know more about your mode of operation? Perhaps...you're dealing with pax PTSD and this is your reaction? Or, how and when did you develop this strategy? Can you tell us more please?",2021

post-6762937,Young Kim,"Jan 12, 2021 at 6:45 PM","I picked up a pax from Rogers Park, IL and brought him to the West Loop at a Hilton hotel. He was an overnight cleaning manager. He told me this remarkable story...

He met a woman who he fell in love with in the Philippines in 2004. They professed their undying love for each other and promised to marry. But........he was a cruise ship worker, and was gone for 10 months out of the year. So from 2004 to 2010, they saw each other just two months out of the year as he rode across the world. He shared with me exotic stories and how fun it was to be a cruise worker... and suggested that I personally would have a LOT of fun.. 

In 2010, he got married to his girlfriend in the Philippines. But he was still devoted to his job. His wife was quite unhappy about this... and eventually she ended up in the U.S., in Chicago as a CNA (certified nurse's assistant). They continued this long distance relationship, albeit with tremendous difficulty until this past year...for TEN years!.

In February of 2020, he discovered that his mother died suddenly of a brain aneurysm. He was distraught, and he quit his job and returned home to the Phillippines. After just ONE MONTH, his father died...presumably from a broken heart. Therefore, he quit his job as a cruise ship worker, and came to the United States, Chicago, to be with his wife............finally.

They now have a one month old baby....and his wife is taking time off as a CNA to take care of his daughter. Now he says he is really happy. But he really misses the cruise ship lifestyle... He did tell me that being away from his wife for almost the entire year was really hard and stressful on the marriage. He did say he had his own cabin because he was a supervisor, and there were many temptations.... He did relay the message that cruise ship workers get down with each other all the time. I did NOT ask him personal questions... I knew it was not my place to do so, but I sensed...

This weekend I did a PU at some non-descript community center, and coming into the parking lot saw signs about ""testing"", which I thought might be driving test, or SAT/GRE test, something like that, didnt give it a 2nd though until...

When the pax jumped into my car, I commented about testing signs, and inquired about ""which test"" was going on...only to be informed that this was the COVID testing site AND that she just had her test, and would receive the results later...I was like ""whaaaat""...why is a pax who might have COVID even in my car?!

Should U/L be dealing with these places? If so, then I'd think we'd need a protocol that...if we're to PU from a potential COVID patient from a COVID testing, we'd need to be informed, and for those who ""opt in""... given some kinda ""hazard pay"".",2021
post-6729067,Big Lou,"Jan 2, 2021 at 9:25 PM","My grand daughter and daughter in law decided to Uber to Downtown Disney and back.
To their horror, the driver did not wear a mask and refused to wear on. They just rolled the widows down and didn't way a word. Of course, I did get a call since I'm in charge of Uber mask.

How irresponsible to be in a contained box and not take any precautions.
Not to mention what it says about the responsible drivers out there.

Needless to mention, I recommended a 1 star with a strong statement.

Got a right away around 2:05 PM, pick up was at a gas station less than a 1/4 mile from my house. Drop off was several miles south toward a place I like to stage. Got a phone call right away. PAX asked me if I could go to pick-up point and pick her up a lighter and deliver it to her hotel as she needed a lighter, the hotel had none and her kid was in the pool. She would tip me the cost of the lighter plus $5.00.

These requests are normally scams, however they usually want beer and or cigarettes or things totaling a bunch more than a $2 lighter. I tell her I'll do it if she sends the request via a message in the app to cover my butt with Uber.

She sends a message right away and tells me to call her when I arrive and she will come to the car and get the lighter.

Okay, what do I have to lose, I'm heading that way anyway. Plus I have several lighters in my car that PAX have dropped on the floor or seat. I grab one of those lighters, start the trip as I near the gas station, and deliver the lighter. She was pretty nice eye candy in her bikini along with several other hotties at the pool. Walks up to my car and hands me $10 and says thanks. Told me I was the 4th driver she contacted, all the rest said no and cancelled the ride right away. I told her it was a typical scam and that is why I asked her to send the message.

Worked for both of us, she paid just over $25 for a used lighter and I made just over $17 to get near the area I like to stage.

post-6753625,Young Kim,"Jan 9, 2021 at 8:31 PM","So last night I had two passengers almost back to back that surprised me on how they even operate in the real day world. The first one was a couple of guys that I picked up around kinsey and halsted in the west loop next to downtown Chicago. They put in the wrong pickup address which was a block away from where they were. Since it was so close I just drove there and then they came into the car. They got in the car and then when I swiped right I noticed the destination was their pickup location! 

So they got very very upset.... And asked me if I could change it and drive them anyway. I said no but they could change the address on their app... After that he got suddenly very upset and stormed out and slammed the door... I called out to him one last time and so sorry for what happened. But he just ignored me completely and went into atrium of his building...

The second rider was even more puzzling. At the end of the ride I told him so the ride is over thank you have a nice day and have a good night and I hope you have a wonderful rest of the year. He said thank you, and then he proceeded to walk around to the other side of the car, opened the door and then got in! (Fully expecting the ride to start!) 

I smiled a big grin and said sorry sir but we're at your home that's the destination that you put. He just sat there for a while...like 30 full seconds... and stared at me and then looked at his phone and called somebody and then got out of the car again and said thank you and have a good night!

There are some passengers like the ones I just mentioned that act in such a bizarre way I hardly understand how they get through the day....",2021

post-6732975,Young Kim,"Jan 4, 2021 at 4:36 AM","I haven't posted stories in just a little while because I was SO busy over the holidays working multiple jobs, family parties, and doing RS of course. Three stories stand out... I Picked up a guy named Abdul in Rogers Park from a 7-11. He was incredibly friendly. He came out and asked right away if I wanted a free drink at his 7-11 because he works there. I said ""sure"", I'll take a slurpee! So I went in and got one and of course showed him a cool magic trick to thank him. He was amazed.

Anyways, he told me a sad story about how during the holidays he won't be able to see his wife and 8 year old daughter because they are in Pakistan. He said he was a refugee and went through multiple countries to seek asylum in the US. He was a strong anti-Muslim in Pakistan, so he had to flee suddenly. He has not seen his young wife and daughter in many years. He is very sad about this. He is trying to get them to the US, but he said it is near impossible now with the pandemic. He said he has a meeting with his caseworker in January. I'll pray for him, please do so yourself!

We finished the ride and he was just the nicest guy you can imagine. I am just so sad that he had to separated from his wife and daughter because he would have been jailed or worse back in his home country. Anyhow, I showed him this trick, five singles to five twenties (some of you already saw this in the ""Chatter Section""), and he was so blown away and we laughed and laughed! By the way, I always carry a few magic tricks in my car for my passengers. I often do Uber after work at a bar or restaurant, so I have them with me. Abdul loved this and said to me how unexpected it was to see an Uber driver do magic...

post-6732381,MyJessicaLS430,"Jan 3, 2021 at 11:14 PM","First of all, my post has nothing to do with driving. Rather than posting on the chatter sub-forum, I would like to share this eye-opening experience from Xfinity with the largest amount of audience as possible.

Long story short, it takes numerous back and forth communications only to learn that the line in my new home is still registered with the previous tenant. It is not a news how incompetent Uber support is - reading scripts that are not relevant to the question. You think it is the worst customer support? Look at this Xfinity agent who kept me waiting for half an hour only to hang up :i'm mad:!!




$55 / mo!! Is this the service I deserve along with poor internet reliability? Because of the fact that the available competitors are racing to the bottom (as far as what I have heard), these companies couldn't care less about service quality or reputation.",2021
post-6729013,#1husler,"Jan 2, 2021 at 9:03 PM","To my friends from Lyft, why have you been peppering my inbox with these messages:


The reason I (and in fact, MANY drivers) dont accept some ride requests is because your ""platform"" remains riddled with a number of rides which pay significantly less than minimum wage.

I concur, its best for ""the community"" to score a return trip McD's drive thru run for $5.00 (and pay me $3.75 for 30 mins of my time, gas and car's wear/tear)... the community always appreciates a timely Walmart pick up to cram two shopping carts worth of groceries, a toddler, service dog into my car to drive .5 mile down the road and pay me $2.25 for that 20 min job....I know third parties dependent on outsourcing rides (with no tips allowed) for their patients who need drivers to drive them home, hold their hands and walk them to their resident doors, at times asking the drivers to open the doors and turn on the lights etc., which is awkward and risky.

Yes, those are few sample of the substantial number of missed ride requests to which you are referring. I will continue to miss them.

Why?, because I've hacked your ""platform"" by learning which rides (a few mentioned here) pay less than minimum wage so I can intentionally ""miss"" those ""ride requests"", and instead cherry pick those which pay more.

Like, for example, last night I got a ping to go to the Greyhound bus depot, only to receive a Uber ping for the airport. Guess which one became a ""missed ride request""?...I of course missed the request to go to the bus depot, because I never get tips from there, in contract to the airport (which are longer rides with tips).

I accepted a request from a drunken gentleman last night who wanted me to break down and load his bike into my car...which elicited a cancellation from me (I dont do bikes and avoid drunks in my car, because they've thrown up in there)...my next stop was a high end cocktail bar where I picked up a couple who gave them a $10 ride and received a $20 tip. I hacked your system to make $30 in 45 mins (that included driving to the drunken the bicyclist + canceling his ride). If I had done the Greyhound bus and the drunk bicyclist I would have make less than a 1/3 of that or less.

So you see, no I don't ""need a break"" (so kind of you to inquire) but rather...I just need to cherry-pick the low stress/low risk, high profit rides out of an otherwise rotten bunch. And yes, this will continue until you realize you cant cajole me into becoming an ant and de-activate me OR change your service delivery model

You have asked if I'm there for pax....and I'd answer the question with a question, asking if you (Lyft) are there for me to be there for pax?

If you sincerely have an interest in making your ""platform run smoothly"", there are a number of ways you could re-configure Lyft for the betterment of ""the community"".

First of all, you could peg a driver's wait time to $1.00 a min. Rest assured, I'd gladly do multi-stops, and wait in the car as long as needed. Secondly, you could up the minimum fare to $5.00. This might entice me to stop in and pick up at the grocery store, to drive pax one mile back home.

Or...if you are suggesting drivers offer social welfare services...you could simply have a 501 c 3 non profit arm, where you welcome us to volunteer x amount of their time to render services at low cost or even no cost...that way, I could drive a pax from the homeless shelter to the clinic and know that I'm doing it simply to contribute to society (not necessarily ""in it for the money"").

This might not solve all the issues between pax (ie, your ""community) and me...but it would go a long way to providing more dependable services (at least, from me) and would keep your platform running more smoothly.

Best.

post-6733017,Young Kim,"Jan 4, 2021 at 5:06 AM","So I'm working New Year's Eve after I did magic at a restaurant, (around 1:00 am), and was in Lincoln Park, IL. I was listening in on their conversation, and I heard the guy say to his wife, ""Our $400 bottle of wine was better than their so called $700 bottle of wine, don't you think dear?"" So I overheard them discuss the wine smoothness, flavor, etc. etc. And I chimed in:

(me) ""It seems you know quite a bit about fine wines. I can't tell because I am sort of allergic to alcohol. I heard that paying so much for a bottle really makes a difference right?""

(him) ""Of course it does!""

And then we discussed how the vintage year (I had known this before) is quite important, even more than the age of the wine. I shared with him that just because a wine is old does not mean that it is great, because the year the wine was produced could have been a bad year for grapes. He agreed and shared with me that 2020 will be an awful year for wines in California because of the fires. To make a long story short, he and his wife always bought extremely expensive wines to drink all the time. And their budget (for just wine) is more than most make in a week.

As I drove to a high rise in downtown Chicago, he and his wife shared with me that they used to go out and eat on most days before the pandemic, and always have breakfast, lunch, and dinner delivered since the pandemic closed many of the restaurants. He and his wife did share that they still often do go out because many restaurants will break the rules and allow in door dining for patrons who they know well.

The wife then warned me that if I go out to dinner with any girl, to not take them to Sephia. She said it was a ""tasting 7 course"" place in Chicago, and cost about $250 per person BEFORE the wine (which obviously they must have), so they spent $800 last they dined there.

He and his wife then told me I should go to a restaurant which I think was ""Everest"" in Chicago. They told me that it costs them over $1000 per meal there, but said it is so worth it. The wife said that there customer service is so good, that they have a person standing right behind you at all times, and the second you need to use the restroom, he pulls out the chair the moment your butt leaves it. Then they change the table settings of course...

We discussed a bit of their vacation habits, and I won't go into further details but it was all over the country and world. He said he was in Florida and now in Chicago and will be moving to Wisconsin next year... So I asked him:

(me) ""Let me guess, you are in a field of medicine?"" (Because he was moving around the country)

(him) ""Yes, Facial Plastics and ENT"" ""My wife is in the field of oncology""...

(me) ""I know that is an incredibly lucrative field, as if yours (to the wife). Now I know why you both can afford to go out so much and buy only the most expensive drinks""

(him) ""Yes, do you know about the field of medicine? You seem very smart.""

I then told him about how I went to medical school but quit and went into the financial world... and do magic, teach physics, and do magic on the side...

(him) ""Do you have any tricks with you?""

(me) ""I'll show you at the end of the ride""

I did the following trick, minus the suitcase because it would be impractical to open my trunk at the end... He was so surprised and loved it and his wife yelled out an expletive. It was a trick where I take a stack of one dollar bills, then change them into 100s. This was the trick... (I always tailor the magic to the passenger. I knew he and his wife would love anything to do with money).


I posted this story because I am reminded that even during times when people are about to be kicked out of their homes because they can't pay rent or their mortgage, others literally are swimming in money... So of sad...

(Also, just to add, even with the magic tricks... (I showed two more), he and his wife left no tip.)",2021
post-6733635,FLKeys,"Jan 4, 2021 at 12:08 PM","Saturday night I picked up a PAX and in our discussions he tells me he needs a Uber to the Airport at 6:30 Sunday morning. I tell I'll be up and hopefully I get the ping. I like those Sunday morning airport trips.

Get up at 5:30 Sunday morning and check the rider app. No drivers online yet. I turn the app on at 6:00 AM. I head out the door as I want to pick up something for Breakfast. Before I get to my car I get the ping for a scheduled ride. I see the pick-up point is where I dropped the guy off and it is a 90 minute trip. Scheduled time, 6:15 to 6:30 leaves me enough time to get breakfast plus will insure I get the MAX long pick-up fee.

Less than a mile from my house I my app beeps and that dreaded there was a problem message pops up on the screen. I knew right away Uber was screwing me out of this trip. Sure enough trip was gone. Another 30 seconds go by and I get a ping for another rider. He was closer but still a long pick-up. I grab breakfast and head to pick them up. Had to make sure I got the most out of the long pick-up fee. His drop off was 1/2 mile from my house. Okay, that works.

1 minute after starting the trip I get another ping, the scheduled ride that they gave me before. At this point there is no way I will be to the scheduled ride by 6:30 as I have an 9 minute trip for the ride I just picked up and a 18 minute ride after that to the second pick-up.

About 5 minutes into the first trip I get another ping request, for the same scheduled trip I already accepted as a stacked ping. I'm thinking what the heck.

Ended up getting to the second pick-up at 6:50 am, 20 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time.

Rider is a little pissed off at this point. Says he saw me accept his ride. He got a there was an error message on his screen and I was gone and he got driver unavailable searching. After a while he got me as his driver again. He than got an update message from Uber that he has a different driver, a lady names Carla. About 30 seconds later he gets the there was an error message again. Searching for driver. Than I show up as his driver again.

I explained what happened on my end and we surmised that Uber put him on hold while they had me complete the other trip first, since no other drivers came online they gave me his trip again after I started the other trip. At some point Carla came online and they gave her the trip taking it from me without me knowing as I was doing another trip still. Carla must have cancelled right away so now the trip came back to me.

In the Driving Preferences on the Uber APP I have Trip Swaps turned off. I guess Uber just uses the were sorry there was a problem message to do what they want.

I got the guy to the airport on time, he was very thankful and ended up dropping me a nice tip later that night.",2021

Most of the students enrolled at Lynhurst Baptist Church Preschool in Indianapolis are children of parents who have worked as essential workers pandemic, and nearly all are from families that fall at or below the poverty line, according to the preschool's director, Renee Dixon.

And all 50 of the preschool's students, plus their siblings, received Christmas presents this year thanks to Dixon, who has spent her weeknights and weekends for the past year as an  and Lyft driver in order to make extra money to buy them gifts.

Dixon, who lost three of her own family members to COVID-19, said enrollment at the school, which serves kids ages 1 to 12, dropped in half during the pandemic as students' parents lost their jobs. She also had difficulty finding work as an Uber driver due to decreased demand, so she signed up as a driver with Lyft, too, picking up rides whenever and wherever she could.

""We are thrilled to see her heartfelt story getting national attention, particularly during a very challenging year,"" a Lyft spokeswoman told ""GMA"" in a statement. ""Lyft was originally created to help build and support communities through transportation so it is wonderful to see people like Renee take that spirit one step further for her students and their families.""

When Dixon earned $100 from her driving, she headed to Target to buy not only toys and games for her students, but also essential items like winter clothing. Faced with decreased earnings from Uber and Lyft, Dixon said she also took money from her own paycheck to buy items for her students.

""This year, with COVID and everything that has really been taken away from the kids, at no fault of their own, I had to do something,"" said Dixon, whose story was . ""The location of where the school is, it's not in the best neighborhood, but we make the best out of everything.""

Even with the odds stacked against her, Dixon said as of last week, she was able to raise over $2,500 this year to spend on her students.",2021
