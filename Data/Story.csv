I say ""no problem"" because I can live with 2-3 minutes. But then she messages back that she ""uses the scheduled rides to give her some extra leeway"". (she is thinking that she has until 9:55 to come out and is starting to get snooty with me). I consider messaging back to tell her, no, she misunderstood how it works but thought better of it as you never know how they will react.

I drive in Chicago, and today I had someone named ozasee for a ride. I discovered he wasn't wearing a mask, and refused to put one on. Once he did, it was under his chin, and I repeatedly asked him to put it on. He put it under his nose, and started complaining about Chicago not having a mask mandate. I explained it was Uber's policy, and Chicago had nothing to do with it. He refused to put it on, so I pulled over to a gas station, and ended the ride. He then refused to get out of the car, and I had to call the police. This is how my day started today. His pickup location was . He was verbally abusive about getting out of the car, and wouldn't get out. Uber sent him a message reminding him about the mask, and he will have to prove with a photo that he's wearing a mask before getting a ride. Nothing about him being rude or anything from Uber. Stupid useless people in that company. Just be warned about this person named ozasee in Chicago.",2021
post-7131178,Benjamin M,"Jul 5, 2021 at 11:59 PM","


As some know here, I decided to go and get a ""real job"" like my wife had been ""suggesting"".

""You know, a W-2. No, I don't care if you don't want to flip burgers! 

Well, I thought that I was doing pretty well driving Uber (after expenses, still about what I earned as a paramedic) but my 2018 Civic hit 70k and gas prices are through the roof.

So, ""real job"".

Back to EMS? Still a maybe. But I'm not in my 20s anymore, a touch of PTSD, and two hernias.

Back to programming? Competitive, also for the young, and I do not want to be behind a desk.

Law enforcement? That was on my horizon before we moved to the big city and ""stuff"" happened.

So, one night, I decided to send a Facebook message to a limousine company that I first noticed before I started rideshare full time, brand new to the city life. Instant reply, I was hired on the spot two days later.

First vehicle I drove was a Chrysler 300. Brakes were shot. Second, another 300, tires were bald and one had an enormous chunk of rubber missing.

Soul searched for about three days (and posted here). Decided to give them the benefit of doubt, just as I would want, emailed them basically saying that they are awesome but I can't drive unsafe shit.

Owner's girlfriend stepped in, took care of everything like a boss, and I am now driving their best. The pandemic nearly killed their business, that section of the fleet is just now becoming more in demand.

Now, Winifred. She had just become a regular when I started - very ""well to do"". First trip was from an independent care facility (now assisted living unit, she's not happy) to the afternoon Mass.

I was warned in advance (and given a salute by her last driver) before I headed to pick her up - third trip for the company. Very demanding pax and she needs a lot of help getting in and out of the car.

She asked me to do five things at once, said she's old enough to be my grandmother (Mom's her age), AC was either too hot or too cold, and made me pull over to find the right radio station. All in the first five minutes 😂

First time waiting for a pax on the job. People were commenting on the fancy car parked by the door to the church. It was her first Mass since the pandemic began.

After I got her situated in the car again, she started to apologize for how she acted before. I cut her off. Told her that I know chronic pain when I see it (arthritic, obese) and how it can definitely **** with your mood. And I told her to stop calling herself old.

Dropped her off, called the company, and told them that if Winifred ever needs a ride to PLEASE let me know. And she requested me for her next trip.

Mass again yesterday, this time I joined her. Boss asked if we needed to charge extra for an escort. 😂

And that's my Sunday moving forward. Paid a decent amount to drive a friend (Winifred said I'd better not think of her as a pax) to church and back.

Oh, and here I am picking up her phone off of the road yesterday because I put it on the roof and forgot. Not a scratch. Divine intervention??😳




Rideshare has been either extremely profitable here or less than minimum wage, just seems to be how the wind blows. Tips are pretty much unheard of, pick up distance is still pretty high for most pings. Pax are still left stranded at our airport.

Even though I'm not totally down with it (seems a bit low), I earn $10/hr from when I leave the ""garage"" (that can be home if the car isn't needed before or between trips) until I return.

unlike Uber and Lyft, tips are included, minimum of 18% - and many fares are $200+. So, no dead miles and no expenses. Lately driving a 2019 Lincoln MKT, 2017 Continental, 2019 Suburban, and soon a 2020 Continental.

Pax run the gamut, from Winifred to newlyweds, executives, flight crews (airport to hotel and back), organ transplant teams, and - last week - a show creator for AMC followed by his lead actor.

I was star struck enough, then had the surreal experience of the main man behind the show asking me to stop so he could literally run a block to an ATM so he could tip me $20 cash (in addition to the $20 or so included, short airport run).

In conclusion, companies like this are hiring. ""Oh, rideshare drivers are un employable"" - bullshit. I submitted a resume, showed up on time wearing a suit, ""here's where the keys are, water bottles are over there, when can you start"" - that was the interview.

So, if you are burnt out being an ""ant"" (hate that term but whatever), consider the option. And I'm part time for now, still ""anting"" on and off.

My theme song right now -

The guy gets in and immediately slams my door but apologizes right away. Fair play I think to myself. At least he apologized. He ended up being a pretty good passenger and he asked me a lot about Uber. I think this might have been his first Uber ride.

At the destination I end the trip and explain that it should pop up on his phone in a minute or so with a record of the trip and what it cost. About 30 seconds later he tells me that he tipped me $10 and would have tipped more but that was the most they would allow. :/

post-7131597,Cvillegordo,"Jul 6, 2021 at 11:40 AM","I've been driving in the Charlottesville Virginia area since the fall of 2019. I have taken rides to Richmond Harrisonburg and Stanton and picked up rides in those areas on the way back. I've also gone as far North as Culpeper but did not get any pings on the way back from there. My understanding has always been that if I were to take a longer trip for example to Dulles airport, that I could set my destination to return and possibly get trips along the way. I have never done this because it doesn't seem to make sense financially, Is too much time and too many dead miles. I've always assumed that I'm not authorized to drive in that area, other than in a return situation. Yesterday I had a conversation with support about my annual inspection. I uploaded the new certificate and they did not automatically lift the hold; I had to call them. After the rep helps me out she did confirm that my area includes anywhere in Virginia. She also said that if I can go online that means I can get trips. My wife and I are in NoVA, DC and Maryland 2 to 4 days a week for her work. I always play with the app to look at surges and so forth, and I have always been able to go online in those areas; I haven't tried to actually take trips or pings simply because I've never been in my car, I'm always in my wife's company car but theoretically I COULD take my car, I spend 4-8 hours amusing myself while she works, the idea is tempting, except for the problem of putting huge miles on my car just for a few bucks.. Support has told me quite a number of incorrect things in the past so is this person correct or is this person confused? Is it true that if you can go online, you will get pings? When my inspection was expired for the last several days, I could still go online - I just wasn't getting any pings. So that tends to refute the information that support told me already.

Doors are locked, I roll down window and ask are you wet, you can't get in if you are wet. If you are still wet I have extra towels in the back. Guy replies no they are not wet. I repeat I have extra towels in the back you can sit on. He says no we are not wet. 

I open the doors and they get in. Take them several miles to a resort. Talk about how people want to get in while wet and I can't drive anymore until my seats dry. She gets out and her towel falls off, okay string bikini the size of yarn explains why she was wrapped up in a towel. I pull away and decided I better check the seat behind me. Idiot lied, I could clearly see where his bathing suit was wet and left my seat wet.

I turn the app off, take pictures and send in a urine complaint to Uber, after all he said he was not wet so he must have pissed his pants.

Replied back that I had to have my seat cleaned as he pissed in it and they replied back that rider claimed his bathing suite must have been wet from swimming. I replied back with the conversation I had with the rider and also uploaded the video and sent them a link. Explained the video clearly shows he said he was not wet.

post-7130089,The Jax,"Jul 4, 2021 at 8:36 PM","I was doing food delivery that day and stopped at Wawa to grab some things to eat and drink in between orders.

I am in line and there is this middle ages black guy in front of me. In front of him was this overweight guy. As the overweight customer is getting rung up, he all of a sudden went on some kind of fart storm. Like if you ate a lot of chili with beans in it and you just have a lot of gas with no expectation of using the bathroom. Just pressure and air.

So it basically went like this.....
<loud fart sound then stops>
""Oh god sorry i'm really sorry""
<more fart sounds after that then stop>
""Oh geez I am really sorry like oh my <fart sound> god""
<more farting>

The black guy in front of me turns around with such a disgusted look on his face like he was in the car driving past the sewage treatment plant on a hot day with the windows down.

Then he speaks LOUDLY while also using his hands in an explaining way....
<black guy voice with actual tactful pausing>
""You know... it smells like... someone is taking a poop... right here...

It did stink in that general area from the farts. When the black guy gets up to the counter to pay, a woman behind me walks past me and offers to pay and thanks him for making her laugh so hard it made her day.

post-7127070,_Tron_,"Jul 1, 2021 at 11:38 AM","Uber badly wants me to drive again. It keeps sending incentive notices to my inbox. So as it happens I have been driving. Since last in the saddle I have lost Gold status, and my ability to see the destination of a ride request is now based upon the newish accepting 5 of 10 ride requests algo.

On the surface, the 5-of-10 algo seems to me like a halfway decent compromise, giving drivers up front details if they simply maintain a 50% acceptance rate. Of course drivers who accept a smaller percentage of rides will note that the low pay makes the 5-of-10 algo a joke. But even in my locale, where Uber still pays 98 cents a mile and 17 cents a minute, the 5-of-10 algo is a clown act. As anyone who has focused on the algo knows, acceptance rate is based upon each individual ride request, rather than on passenger request.

The downside of this nuanced difference played out for me yesterday with ""Darren"". Darren wanted a ride. Badly. His request for a long ride on the Lyft platform came to me, and I declined it. For my own good reasons I was unable to accommodate a pax who wanted a ride out of town. After all, I am an Independent Contractor and it is my right to choose which rides work for me. Darren then came in on the Uber app, which I also declined, lowering my 9 of 10 acceptance rate one notch. Undaunted, for the next half hour Darren toggled back and forth between platforms, requesting his out-of-town ride.

Uber, in all its wisdom, kept sending me Darren's requests. The algo was too dumb to realize that if I turned the request down once, nothing was going to change 5 minutes later. But the requests kept coming, and I noticed my acceptance rate was dropping with each successive decline. Finally, while on another ride, Darren's request came in again. Only this time there was no destination. I didn't realize the request was from stubborn Darren, and stupidly accepted it.

I drive the 10 minutes to the pickup point, then down a 1/4 mile dirt road, which cakes the back of my freshly washed car with dust, only to realize after starting the ride that my pax was the now infamous Darren. ""Darren, I'm so sorry. I can't drive you to xxx. I know there's not a lot of Uber cars on duty right now (being that a lot of drivers are still preferring UI) but I just can't do it"". Darren, whose family is just starting up a pot farm, replies in a most mellow way that it is totally cool, and to just drop him back to his pickup location. I do and move on.

Uber. Dude. I just want a reasonable driving experience. Anything less than that and you are de-incentivizing me. Get it?

post-7119622,Cvillegordo,"Jun 24, 2021 at 9:41 AM","We have been having promotions every day, $6 per ride, so our small downtown area where the promotion applies is flooded with drivers. You can sit around and wait for one of the promo rides, or, if you want to make money, you can take what comes your way and hopefully a few of the very short $10 rides will come your way as well. Yesterday I took a 20 minute pick up at our airport for a 20 minute ride. Normally and especially during these promotions I get in touch with the rider and make sure that he is coming back towards the downtown area. 90% of the time that would be the case; if they say they're going North or West towards Harrisonburg I would probably cancel. I don't want to end up 45 minutes away from the downtown area and possibly deadhead all the way back. In this case I got no answer on my text, and assuming that the guy was probably waiting for his bag or just on the phone I went ahead to the pick up anyway. Surprise! Going north to Ruckersville. S.hit!! Oh well. Took him home, $22 ride and $5 tip, OK. Set destination back to downtown and luckily got two trips along the return, one short and one all the way back downtown. Both of these tipped, feeling lucky and good at this point. Then I got the phone call. My airport passenger thinks he left his phone in my car. I look around the back and there it is under the seat on the side where he dropped it. (His girlfriend is smoking hot, and not shy by the way. Kids, this is why you should lock your phones.) So I made the honest and well intentioned mistake of telling him that I found it. This nice guy with the hot girlfriend immediately turned into an entitled jerk and demanded that I return ""my property!"" to him at his house, which is now more than 45 minutes away from my location. At this point I had already accepted another trip so I told him to call me back in half an hour. A few minutes later I got in touch with support and they confirmed to me that since I had informed the passenger and Uber that I found his property, I was now obligated to return it to him. Good Lord, what a freaking nightmare. Surge popping up on top of the promotion in the downtown area, it's heating up as people are starting to return to their hotels and homes from going out to eat, I'm going to miss making some really good money if I drive all the way out to this dude's house again. He calls me again for the 4th time. He is getting upset and is very pushy, continues to demand that I drive to his home and return his property. I push my luck and fib; tell him that I cannot possibly drive all the way to Ruckersville as ""I'm at the end of my shift."" After a near meltdown he acquiesces and agrees to meet me half way. I suggest Walmart and he finally agrees. Walmart is fortunately much farther for him than for me, so I came out OK on this. Drove to Walmart did a little shopping, met the guy in front, returned his phone and he didn't say a word; no ""thank you!"" nothing. What a jerk, and lesson learned; never again will I admit to finding a phone from a distant drop off and never again will I drop anyone off at a distance without thoroughly checking around the back seat. After over 5,000 trips I know better, this was a stupid mistake. But I got my $15 returned item fee, and after another long talk with support they also added a bonus $6 promotion to my account.",2021

post-7123436,Haanjo,"Jun 28, 2021 at 12:10 AM","I picked up an Uber Eats order from a discount restaurant.

As I'm about to arrive at the customers apartment, a phone call comes in. I figure it's the customer who wants to give me special instructions to get to their place, so I answer.

Turns out it's the restaurant manager. He said he was not watching the front desk, and his employee forgot to give me the drinks that went with the order.

I tell him to refund the drinks, and I'm not coming back because I don't get paid to go back and deliver the drinks, and besides, it's his employee's responsibility to give me the correct order.

He tells me its between the customer and Uber, and its my responsibility to get the order right too. I tell him not only was his employee rude, but not to blame me for his employees mistake.

He tells me to tell the customer that I forgot his drinks. I tell him I'm done talking to him, to have a good night, and hang up the phone. At this point, I'm pretty irritated, and basically had already raised my voice when he blamed me for the mistake.

Yeah, I know, I could have checked for drinks, but when an employee hands me an order, I'm going to assume its correct. Every once in a while I do check orders for drinks, and occassionally I do catch errors, but I'm not going to waste my time and check the accuracy of orders everytime, especially if 97% of the time the orders are correct anyway, which is my satisfaction rate after this order.

What I didn't realize until I hung up, is that the restaurant can actually give you negative feedback, and when I checked my rating for deliveries, sure enough, the manager dinged me. Apparently the customer dinged me too...about 5 minutes after I checked my rating from the merchant, my customer satisfaction rating had dropped from 98% to 97%...which I suspect happened when the customer called the restaurant and the manager blamed me for the mistake.

Anyway, I came really close for telling the manager to F*** Off, so I'm glad I kept my cool. 

So, if you ever find yourself of the situation, first off, don't be an idiot like me and answer your phone like I did, and if you do answer the phone, be careful what you say to the store manager. Having said that, you aren't a store employee, and if they try to blame you for their employee screwing up, tell them to shove it, because at the end of the day, it's on them and not you.",2021

post-7108895,Haanjo,"Jun 13, 2021 at 3:15 AM","Dear Ridershare Passengers,

When I'm waiting for you, I will wait 5 minutes. Not 5 minutes and one second. 5 minutes is 5 minutes. I only get paid roughly 12.5 cents per minute of wait time, and while I'm waiting for you, I'm missing out on other rides. 

And don't say you will tip me extra because often people who say that don't tip at all. For the record, sometimes I get paid more for cancelling the ride than I do for the ride itself, and keep in mind, I'm often parked in an odd spot waiting for you, sometimes blocking traffic, and sometimes dealing with drunk idiots who are trying to steal your ride.

And for the record, I understand that sometimes you need to pay your tab at the bar before you can leave. I get that. But you had a 15 minute notice for me to get there, while I was finishing up my last ride, plus another 5 minute notice while I was on my way to pick you up after dropping off my last passenger.

So, there is no excuse to not be waiting at the curb when I pull up. And for the record, when I started doing rideshare three and a half years ago, I used to bend over backwards for my passengers like you. But often, five minutes would turn into ten minutes, and when I bent over backwards for my passengers the most, you would be a bad passenger, things would go terribly wrong on the ride, and you would give me a one star rating for my efforts.

Over 11,000 rides later, I've learned from riders like you. 

When you say stuff like,

""Be right there"",

What you really mean is that you are going to be late. And if I've been patient enough to wait for you for the entire 5 minutes and beyond, no, you can't smoke a cigarette before we leave...get in the freaking car!

So there you have it. I'd like to be a nice guy and wait, but you need to show some courtesy and respect for your driver, and not sit there and socialize with your friend up until the last possible second, because once I hit the gas pedal and start to take off, it's too late, and yelling at me to come back isn't going to change things.

And for the record, it took something like 8,000 rides with 800 late passengers to develop this attitude.  Bottom line is I'm not messing around anymore. So be ready!

Love, 

Your Driver............Vrrrooooooom!",2021

Many of us have had pax tell us that other drivers let them do stuff we didn't, like fitting 5 pax in a small car and the like.

What are some of the most common or best ones you've heard?",2021
post-7067574,#1husler,"May 6, 2021 at 3:24 AM","Pax have been holding court, talking smack and spilling the tea (so to say) about all the kinds of drivers they really don't like, and why they give one stars and complaints. 

Here are some most common categories pax seem to talk about:

1. The odd-ball. Sure, it goes without saying that RS would attract its share of society's outliers (ie, those who need to pay the bills but can't manage a W-2 gig), but some seem to take it one step beyond, to the point of turning off, or even freaking out pax. Stand out examples, according to pax, include one guy who had a pit bull riding shotgun (service dog? who knows???), a woman who kept addressing a male pax as ""Martha"" (even after he corrected her) and another lady who had the inside of her car decked out with pulsing disco lights. 

2. The maniac on the streets. Its one thing to drive like a ""bat out of hell"" to hustle to the drop off ASAP, but completely another to almost cause multiple accidents, get into an unsparring amount of altercations (both verbal and physical) with other drivers on the road until pax pleads to end the ride early and be let off at the nearest corner. Not good for ""The Community""!

3. The slob. No pax likes getting into stranger's car which looks (and smells) like a junk yard. Even if their own car is that way or worse, they won't tolerate it when ""Ubering"" or ""Lyfting""... pax complain the some drivers car get super gross, and they have roll the windows because of the funky odor....drivers grouse about pax eating in their cars, but a number of drivers (as reported by pax) are the one's munching away, with a sandwich and/or burrito in hand, while driving, food slipping everywhere. Clearly a one star ride there. 

4. The anti-social introvert. Many of us (yours truly included) remain open to talking shop with a pax, about this and that, to establish rapport to pull down a tip. So it's surprising how many drivers don't work that tip, and instead simply unlock the door, set the GPS and drive in total silence, arrive, unlock door, done...no greeting and welcome, confirmation of name and destination, ""how's it going?"" etc, nothing. And I'm not talking about members of the Deaf Community who are driving...I mean the folks who take the whole ""our job is just to just to drive pax from point A to point B"" ethos a bit too literally. One pax recounted how they get into the car, told her driver ""good morning"" and received a grunt as a response, followed by glowering stare through the mirror. She canceled the ride (I might have too). 

Do any of you fill into these groups?

post-7110055,June132017,"Jun 14, 2021 at 2:27 PM","Reflecting back on 4 years into the game, but is it? I took massive time off in 2020 due to the pandemic. Ride share requests had dropped dramatically in late March 2020. 

I would say the respect from my friends went way down since i've become a rideshare driver. I would say overall my happiness went way up though.

Moneywise I'd say this gig isn't worth it. I think we pay too much fixing our cars and putting gas into them. My previous job didn't pay that much though. So it's not like I left a $100K job for this, or something. Also, you don't get alot of time off doing rideshare. People don't respect rideshare drivers and we put alot of work into it. Honestly I can't say I blame them after taking a few rides from other drivers. 

Running into people I used to know was a pretty big highlight for me. I helped a friend go 90 miles down the road the one day. I guess not a friend, but someone who went to elementary school with me. It was weird he was literally 80 miles from the school we went to. Then months later, I ran into someone else I knew and we decided to have dinner. That was pretty cool and one of the few times I left the car. 

Another time some guys from a small town Illomois decided to make a stop at Wendy's and I was hungry too. Lol, we all had lunch together. Then just dropped them off at a theme park after we ate.",2021

In a few seconds I suspect he might be drunk, he is making strange sounds. I'm alarmed, ask what is wrong with him.

""He's in severe abdominal distress! Hurry!!"" His is now groaning which becomes almost screaming. Looking in the mirror, I realize he is holding a gallon sized ZipLoc baggie containing vomit. 

Oh h.ell no.

""I am not comfortable with this trip. You need medical transportation.""

""It's not contagious. Hurry!""

He says; ""the mthr.fking ambulance costs $3,000. Just get me to the fking hospital. ""

This ride is over. By now I have progressed around the block, there is a gas station and market, lots of people. I inform them that I am not comfortable with the ride, i am ending it here, they need to call 911 for an ambulance. 

He explodes. ""Mthrfking racists mthrfkr! You just hate black people. You mthrfking racist!"" This rant continued and got louder, and he wasn't moving. I stepped out and called 911. They realize what I'm doing, get out, he continues the rant and it now progresses into threats. I get in, drive across the street, tell dispatch the threat is over and no need to respond. then I call the Uber safety line and tell them what happened. 

About an hour later, I get an email.

""A rider recently claimed that you declined their trip based on the destination provided. We wanted to let you know about this report because refusing a trip based on destination goes against the  as well as local regulations in many areas, and could result in loss of access to the Driver app.""

I responded with a detailed account of what happened and received an email in return basically said everything was OK.

Two blocks down the road to a lawyer's office to drop off a form! She said she didn't know how to add a stop so I showed her on the app and she said she needed to go home- 1 1/2 hours away in afternoon ATL traffic. She was very tired and I knew she wouldn't get a ride any time soon at that time of day, so I said add a good tip and I would do it. She agreed and off we went together, her talking non stop all the way. I even stopped and bought her a water. I helped her to her door and turned around for an hour dead leg back to ATL. 
Yep, no tip. I feel like I got played. I think this has been used before with other drivers...SO NO MATTER WHAT, END THE RIDE FIRST!

A couple of minutes into the ride he appeared to be getting agitated, sighing etc. I did have to go backwards a little bit before heading towards the destination, because of the nature of the several lane road etc., but nothing too out of the ordinary. 

About halfway through the ride he asked if he could roll down the window. I said sure, no problem, and I cracked mine as well to avoid the reverb. I asked him if it was too hot and he said no (my A/C was set to an appropriate level).

I don't think he was concerned about COVID because he wasn't wearing a mask until right before he got into my car. I did have an almost full cup of very strong coffee, but I've never gotten a complaint about that and even regular compliments on the aroma.

I dropped him off at his destination and then it dawned on me: the egg salad sandwich I had purchased at a convenience store and placed on the passenger seat was giving off an aroma. If he had smelled it through the coffee aroma, he probably thought I was a gassy driver. I moved the sandwich to the hatchback before picking up my next pax.

Waiting for a bad rating or even a complaint, but I hope to avoid it. He was a 4.98, like me, so hopefully he gives me the benefit of the doubt.

post-5418554,TXUbering,"Sep 22, 2019 at 1:31 AM","I was in a hellish part of town the other night in an area with a lot of bars and restaurants. Typically the pax just want you to shuttle them from one bar to another, which isn't worth the headache. But, I figured I'd go ahead and play the role of good ant and accepted the request. 

I find the location of the pick-up and decided I didn't want to be ""that ant"", and hold up traffic waiting for my pax. So, I pull off into a side street and wait parked next to the building, right at the pincushion. I sat there waiting for my pax when 3 clowns decided for whatever reason to stand right next to my passenger door, somewhat inhibiting my view, and peoples' view of my vehicle. Attempted to contact the pax several times, no answer. 

Five minutes later (stupid Comfort 7 minute wait), and still no sign of her. Look over and the 3 jackasses are still just standing there. One of the asshats decides he wants to lean his hand on my car, to which I slowly put the car in reverse, and clip his arm with my side mirror. With the windows rolled up, I still manage to hear him say, ""You could've asked!"" I responded in turn with, ""Get off my &#^@ car!"" I was actually hoping that they'd start something as I was already getting frustrated by the most likely drunk woman making me wait. But, they just decided to walk down the street with no drama. 

I'm not sure what planet that dillhole was from where he actually thought that I needed to ASK him to get off my car. It's not a park bench, it's my personal property ya schmuck! 

Waited the full 7 minutes and decided to just shuffle her. Oh well, $9.00 for nothing. My guess is she was trying to catch the last few minutes of a college game and thought I'd wait for her past the wait time.",2019

post-7063411,Haanjo,"May 2, 2021 at 1:44 PM","Actually, it was more like 35 seconds...

Last night I had a Lyft pickup at a pool (billiards) bar at around 12:30 am.

After about a minute and a half of waiting, a guy comes out and says, ""Wow, you were fast"", not realizing he had been in my que for close to 25 minutes, and was less than 2 miles from my last drop off. He then goes back into the bar.

At around the 4 minute mark, he comes back out and says he is waiting for his friend, and proudly says he will make it worth my while if I wait. I simply respond with the universal ""ok, ok"". At that point I explain to him that he has about 30 seconds...and he runs into the bar to get his friend.

The clock ticks down to zero, and he still hasn't shown up, so naturally I bolt. With around 11,000 Uber and Lyft rides to date, I no longer mess around. I'm serious when I say you have 30 seconds...

As I take off, I hear him yell, ""That wasn't 30 seconds, sir"", but the reality is that it was closer to 35 seconds...or more accurately 5 minutes and five seconds or so.

I don't get why so many people take so long to get ready. In my case, whenever I book Lyft ride, I'm ready before the driver gets to my pickup location. In this case, I get that my rider was probably finishing up a game of pool, but at this stage of the game, I don't put up with the BS I put up with when I was a new driver, and I won't hesitate to leave you behind if you are not ready, or if you chose to socialize with your friends for even 3 minutes...I will not hesitate to leave you behind if you don't give me the same respect as I given other Lyft drivers when they pick me up.

This video shows the entire ride, start to finish. I sped up the parts with no dialogue. Here's a summary:

0:00-0:34 - greeting and confirmation of destination. Pax has an obvious bad attitude from the start.
1:59-2:15 - Pax sends me a text through app: ""I don't like your music, [name]"". I ask her ""You don't like my music? You want me to turn it off?"" to which she remains silent. I switch off the radio. At this point I start to worry about this pax. This was the most bizarre thing to happen during my 2000~ rides.
3:25-end - I ask the pax, ""So, now I'm curious, what kind of music do you like to listen to?"" to which she responds ""I don't have any interest in speaking with you."" That's when I pulled over to cancel the ride. That's when the fireworks happen.

Notes: 1) I have a big, obvious wedding band on my ring finger, I don't flirt with pax, and this one wasn't even attractive. 2) We had listened to Beatles' ""Here Comes The Sun"", but apparently she really didn't like listening to Pink Martini's rendition of ""Bolero"". 3) I am starting a new job very soon, so my tolerance for pax bullshit is at an all-time low. None of them ever get to treat me like The Help in my own car ever again. Deactivation from a false accusation from her, or from posting this video online? I don't care.

Weekend started off bad with my 3rd trip being and Uber Scammer. I'll post more about that in Uber Eats.

Had more cancels this past weekend than I have had so far this year.

First cancel, Friday Night, this guy was way to drunk to be getting in my car. Here is a series of screen shots from my dash cam. Easy pass, he actually fell again when he got past my front bumper giving me room to drive off. Luckily he fell away from my car.

Two more cancels Friday night where PAX texted me just before the 5 minutes was up that they were on the way. I was not in the mood to pick up people that made me wait. Waited out timer and drove off with cancel fee. Ended up calling it a night out of frustration and headed home.

Saturday started out okay. Friday's Uber Eats episode still lingering I opted not to turn eats on the rest of the weekend. Soon the cancels started rolling in. 6 for the day, 3 PAX cancelled as I arrived at pick-up point, 2 I cancelled for No Show. The final cancel was this little peach. Hard to see her in the picture, boy friend is leaning over her as she is puking out her guts. Good Bye, let someone else deal with that.




Last trip Saturday night, pick-up at a wedding property and take a couple to their resort. They were discussing that they need to leave at 8:00 AM to get to the airport on time. Non eventful 3 mile trip. I head toward my next pick-up and see flashing lights in my mirror for a brief second. Than nothing. Get to my pick-up and the guy gets in and says hey someone left their phone. Damn, bet that was the flashing light I saw. Drop them off pretty close to resort I dropped last couple off at. Select found item option and previous trip. Used call PAX option and sure enough it was his phone as it started ringing. Went by their cottage at the resort and knocked on door. No answer. Oh well, left a note on their door to contact Uber. Turned phone off and put it in an electronics bag so they could not track it to my house.

Get up early Sunday looking for an airport trip or two. Get a ping that just looks funny, no addresses that I recognize. I accept and start to get ready to walk out the door. I get a text message saying please call me. I call PAX and he tells me where he is at. He wants me to come pick him up some 40 miles away an take him to Aventura some 120 miles away. He proceeds to tell me the app keeps telling him no drivers available where he is at so he kept randomly putting in trips. I tell him I can't drive 40 miles un paid for a trip that will take me 80 miles from where I live. He says tell me what address to put in that is close to where I am at and he will put in a multi stop trip to come get him, take him to Aventura and he will take care of my return miles. A couple of minutes later I get pick-up updated so I continue out the door. Trip started 1 minute from my house, to 40 miles south for first stop.

I was passing the resort from PAX that left phone in my car so I stopped and knocked on door again. I also had already turned the phone back on to see if they would try and call it. My note was still there, and I knew they were planning on leaving in about an hour and I would be on a long trip and not able to return the phone. No answer. Oh well, off I go to pick-up my PAX. About 10 minutes away from my pick-up the left phone rings. I answer it and pretty much tell the guy he is out of luck as I was on a long trip. Told him I would ask my PAX I was picking up if they minded if I stopped to drop the phone off. Told him to call back in 15 minutes.

Get to the stop and a guy comes out and says he needs a few minutes and says thanks for going out of your way and slips me some cash. I ask him if he was okay with me dropping of the phone, he was sure that is fine. I look at the cash he hands me, a very, very, generous tip. As I'm waiting at his Ocean front house I notice the multiple high end cars, couple of antique jeeps, 2 sizeable boats, 6 wave runners, and two crotch rockets. Man this guy is not hurting for cash at all. A few minutes later he comes out with a piece of eye candy in a tight little dress. Some back and forth conversation and he gives her an envelope. Does not take long to figure out he is a pay to play type guy. Lady gets in my car and has a very quite voice with a unique accent. He is staying, she is going with me, he thanks me again. She makes a phone call and I realize she is speaking Russian. Next thing I know she is laying down in my back seat.

Other guys phone rings, and I arrange for him to be standing on the side of the road so I can just pull over and hand him the phone. 30 minutes later I get to point he is standing there and I hand him the phone and he hands me $60. He looks at my PAX in the back seat, gets a shocked look and then laughs. I look back and her dress has rode up and her ass is just hanging out. Yep, you guessed it, no panties. She is sound a sleep.

Here is a not so revealing picture after she rolled over and kind of fixed herself. Ended up dropping her off outside Trump International Beach Resort where her ,I'm guessing, pimp was standing outside a Cadillac Escalade waiting for her.

As we drove, she outlined how she first became vegan after watching the movie ""Earthlings 2005"". It is a movie about how animals are treated before they become meat for the population. It is narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. After the ride, I did watch just the preview on YouTube, and I actually shed tears (I never before shed a tear watching just a movie preview). I often like to ask a passenger who I made a solid connection with, ""What are you most passionate about in life?"" She answered with emotion...this particular pax was on a mission to turn everyone she knew to understand how animals suffer before they make it to our dinner plates. I was awestruck by her emotion and persuasion. I've met many vegetarians before, but often they were for religious reasons. This is one of the first who went all out vegan after seeing a movie and then doing her own studies.

I drove yesterday and today (Fri/Sat) and noticed the small serge amounts they share with us is significantly higher then the past few weeks since they rolled out the new serge crap, especially on Gryft. They were offering $25 power zones on all of my rides I took in Orange County when I got back from driving in LA. I absolutely hate short rides but was welcoming the jackass pax's that were going 4 blocks. I made a cool $125 in about 55 mins from 5 back to back rides on Gryft between 9pm-10pm Sat night. I hadn't actually seen the power zones in months so it was a surprise to see them at such high amounts. I even took a Gryft ride from LAX to Fountain Valley with a $28 bonus. Dubers serges were ranging between $10-$30 in O.C. Sat night. I also noticed that Duber is again putting the Long Ride 45min message back on. From Fri/Sat night working from 5-10pm each night I cleared just short of $500!

""At a junction with a four way stop sign, four cars arrive at their respective stop signs at the same time. Who has the right of way.""

""Nobody"", I replied

""Incorrect"", replied the interviewer. ""The correct answer is the driver to your right.

""Incorrect"", I replied. ""If four cars arrive at the same time, then each car is to the right of another driver, meaning that all cars have right of way which, in turn, means that none of them does - none would have more right than any of the three drivers do.

""That's what the California drivers' handbook says"", said the interviewer.

""Then, in this case, the handbook is wrong"", I replied.

When I arrive at the same time as another vehicle at a multi-way stop sign:

- If the other driver is in a BMW or Audi, then the driver will believe (s)he automatically goes first, so I just let them.

- Any other driver, they will usually hesitate and dawdle, resulting in a Mexican standoff. I hit the gas and go.

It was in a decent neighborhood, in broad day light and in perfect spring/summer weather to boot.. seemed an excellent day for short 5 -10 min walk...so what gives I wondered?

Me: Ok, I see...we're going around the corner there?

Pax: I know, its only 3 blocks, but I didn't feel like walking home from work today

Me: Oh cool. Do you usually ""Uber"" because home and work then?

Pax: Not always, I walked to work this morning, but I just feel too lazy to do it this afternoon, so....

I've seen this before...last weekend it was somewhat similar...I picked up a couple on a lovely warm, sunny afternoon, they were grousing about having to wait more than an hour for their PU (because of the driver shortage), so I said I'd shave a few mins off their ride...only to slide and see that the ride was only a min, around the corner to the bar. 

Both these ride were fine with me...because this PUs were each only like 3 mins away from me and I was chasing down promos on them (I knocked out these rides in under 5 mins total)....but aside from that it seems a waste during an ""Uber shortage"" to take lazy pax 3 blocks down the road to get a beer while others need to go to the airport, etc., and are getting a ""no car available"" response...I'm wondering if Uber would hike minimum fares (AND share it with drivers) during this so-called ""driver shortage"" to better utilize drivers.",2021

He was such a friendly guy and we discussed how going to school now would not allow him any decent experiences. He said that friends ahead of him in college have all remote learning and cannot attend classes or socialize (like going to sports games, clubs, bars, study halls). So he said that he will postpone entering school until he can really have all the experiences he wanted. 

I thought that was problably the best choice. I told him that it was likely the right decision, as college happens only once in your life, and going now may not be the best decision, especially because the cost of college is so great.

post-7066706,The Gift of Fish,"May 5, 2021 at 11:37 AM","Time for another What Would You Do poll. It was Tuesday night and business was very slow in SF when I got a ping from the airport, 9 miles away from my location. Uber was offering $55 for a 49 mile ride east. 100 miles total and around 2 hours, and gas for the trip would cost around 9 bucks, so $23 revenue per hour after gas. Way below target earnings, but it would be an easy freeway ride and the city was as quiet as underwater flatulence, so I accepted.

Then the message came in from the pax:







Pax tells me she is at the terminal. I tell pax that I cannot pick up from the terminals. Pax replies that she will go to a different terminal. 'Cause if the driver says that he can't pick up from the terminals, only from the designated pickup area, it does of course make sense to suggest a different terminal to be picked up from. Because who knows where the pickup area is. Shoot me now.

By this point the pax had confirmed herself as a fully-fledged moron. Your choices as a driver are:

1) Try to give pax step-by-step instructions on how to find the pickup area. (a) Look for the signs, (b) walk in direction indicated by signs, (c) stop walking when pickup area is reached. The moron is strong in this pax; chance of success: 10%

2) Do an illegal pickup at the terminal where the pax is. Chance of success: 80%. Chance of $100 ticket from airport cops: 20-40%.

3) Drive to pickup area, wait 5:00 and then no show pax. Drive to airport was 9 miles; no show fee will be around 9 bucks. Chance of success: 100%

post-3951419,ftupelo,"May 18, 2018 at 12:51 PM","Howdy all you Ants! On this episode of I'd like to discuss the proper construction of your retirement portfolio. Since UBER does not provide us with 401k's, it is incumbent upon ourselves to construct a retirement plan that fits our needs. Now, I am not a certified financial planner (no CFP designation), but I am an expert in the fields of finance and investing.  That said, I can provide the board with my approach to investing, which may work for some, but everyone should do their own research and construct a plan that works for them and helps them achieve their goals, all within the confines of their own personal risk appetite.

Most importantly, and regardless of how you choose to invest your savings, an ant  save. Various sources will advocate setting aside different percentages of your income in savings. Taking that approach is fine, but I save as much as humanly possible and likely well above the suggested percentages. We  get in the mindset that money is not just a means of exchange, it is an asset that can be deployed to earn its own return. We  understand the wonders of compounding and how important it is to initiate this plan as early as possible in one's career. IRA's can be a useful vehicle to start saving for many of us. However, some of us will not be able to utilize this structure if you and your old lady make more than $200k annually.

Once the ant has decided to start saving and picked their desired vehicle, they must decide how they wish to allocate their capital. I am personally a fan of the endowment model popularized by David Swensen while at Yale. The problem for most is that it takes a sizeable capital base to be able to deploy this strategy. Fear not, one can take a modified approach to attempt to match the returns and volatility profile of the endowment model - something Frankie-T calls the modified endowment model.

Public equities and bonds should be the cornerstone of every ant's portfolio. I personally use Vanguard ETF's to achieve the desired exposure for very low fees - fees are, in this day and age, an unnecessary drag on portfolio returns. In this bucket, beyond your traditional S&P 500 type equities and treasuries or corporate bonds funds, you may want to include ETF's that have exposure to emerging markets, commodities, REITS, Collateralized Mortgage Backed Securities, BDC's, or other assets with solid yields. However, we must keep in my that dividends are taxed when distributed, so this approach may not be the best for folks in high tax brackets. Tax efficiencies are an often overlooked aspect of portfolio construction.

I addition to these staples, I like to add in more esoteric assets in order to mimic the endowment model. Some of the easiest ways to get these exposures are to purchase a home, which should increase in value, rental properties, cryptoassets (which includes owning, mining, running masternodes, and staking), precious metals, and music royalties. I like to create a bucket for these alternative assets and then distribute this bucket into these other assets mentioned. The goal of this approach is to diversify assets, minimize correlations, minimize volatility, provide some passive income through yield and dividends, and achieve returns in most market conditions. Unfortunately, most of us will not have access to LP investments in funds in private equity, venture capital or hedge funds - however, the right mix of investments can give you similar returns.

I think this is a good start as a primer on retirement investing, however, I would like to open it up to the ants to suggest other favorite investments or investment strategies. We are always interested in trying to achieve outsized returns and I believe the collective wisdom of the crowds is the best approach to trying to do so.

Thank you and toodles,

Frankie",2018

Ahead of me was a brand new ES with a temporary plate whose driver was waiting for somebody to open the building main gate. Obviously the driver doesn't live here as he walked toward me and signalled that he was picking up somebody. He is an older gentleman in the late 50s and politely asked if I could buzz him in. Sure. I needed to get inside too 🤣 . 

The first thing I realized is his hat that reads US Marine. Out of curiosity, I asked whether he was still actively serving (may be a position of command, intelligence or training the newly recruits, etc). By the time I entered the passcode, he said he no longer served and was no different than any other citizen. Then I thought we would part our ways after a simply reply with ""Oh, I see"". When I was about to leave, the same car was still parking by the garage gate with hazard lights on. I then offered to open the garage gate beside the main gate such that he could wait inside the building. He said ""That is sweet of you but I don't know which floor my  lives"".

Wait a second, did he say ? ""Sorry, by any chance are you driving Uber or Lyft?"", I asked. Later, he told me that it was the second week doing rideshare as a means of distraction from the pain of losing his daughter to TNBC (triple negative breast cancer). ""I am so sorry for the loss, I know how hard it is to accept the reality of tested negative for all the receptors"". Before I answered his question about my background, I thought it was far more important for him to learn how not to be taken advantage of. ""Sir, I know this is not my business but I think you should shuffle and move on. It has already been almost 15 minutes since we first met. You should have cancelled the ride"". Personally I despise any behaviours that abuses the older generations. Unlike the cunning, deceitful and entitled youth, the elder adults are honest and hard-working humans. They don't deserve to be treated like this. 

After leaving him confused, I disclose that I am a former driver. This just gets to my nerves how his kindness is abused. I left him my contact if he wanted a rideshare 101.

Things have been crappy over the past two years for all of us. Lots of concerns regarding health and maybe even losing loved ones. This gig has been unpredictable and more stressful. 



I gained a great friend, a local driver. I have enjoyed our almost daily conversations over several months, sharing our good and bad stories and helping each other out. 

I am thankful for starting a plan toward improving myself (physically, mentally, and financially) and my family helping my wife and I to find a new home. 

I am thankful for the fact that RS and delivery has kept me occupied during this mess and has been mostly profitable. And for this gig getting me out and earning in the first place when I really had no path in sight (next to nothing to $38k). 

Please try to share something positive.  will appreciate that the local driver (name yourself) is likely tired of my endless *****ing. 😂",2021

It's a small sample but I found riders to be a little more appreciative. 
There are more promotions then there were March 2020.

post-7057886,Aw Jeez,"Apr 27, 2021 at 10:27 PM","I read posts on this forum and I get the impression that some of you really don't this job and really don't like our customers. And I always want to ask: Why do you do this? By now, everyone should realize that Uber is not a great full-time job - if it ever was. By now, you can't exactly blame Uber for your particular situation. You've had plenty of time to re-evaluate and get out if that's what you want. And so, again I wonder: Why keep doing something you so obviously dislike?

Middle-aged couple got in the car at a hotel the other morning. Black couple but I don't think it matters. Woman asks me to pop the truck, so I do and then I hop out and help them load their numerous bags. As we leave for the short ride to the airport, I ask them about their stay and such. Just idle chit-chat. When we get to the airport, I hop out and go get one of the little baggage carts they provide. This ain't New York, it's pretty chill here and I didn't have another ride stacked.

""You're the best Uber driver ever!"" the old guy goes. Which I know is not true, but he meant it sincerely. ""Our last two drivers ignored us...wouldn't help with the bags, didn't talk to us...made us feel like we were imposing on him."" I thanked them and wished them a pleasant trip home. By the time I was out of the airport, I saw the $10 tip on top of the $5.71 fare.

Look, this job really isn't that hard or that bad. Just be nice to people...treat them like human beings, not some big inconvenience or annoyance. If you don't like people, perhaps ride-sharing is not the field for you. If you're not making enough money doing ride-share, perhaps it's not the field for you. And if you resent passengers for not living up to your expectations at the beginning, middle or end of the ride, perhaps ride-share is not the field for you.

Me, I happen to love this job! Every day, I thank God that Uber came along and got me out of driving a taxi (which was okay but a lot more work for the money). I've had a lot of fun jobs...but mainly I've been a helicopter pilot most of my life, and doing  job is the most fun I've ever had. No, I'm not getting rich, and I'm putting about 30,000/year on the car, which is fine. Uber/Lyft gives me about $2,400 - $2,500 per month in my bank account. I could make more if I wanted to work harder, but I don't.

Some of you guys really need an attitude check. The passengers are not your enemy. I wish some drivers would stop treating them as though they are. It makes it hard for the rest of us.

I was only a minute away and am now at the gate. I call the PAX and he answers. I say Hi, this is FL Keys from Uber I'm at the gate and need a gate code. He acts all stupid and says he has no idea what I am talking about, he didn't order a ride, and he is not sure he even has Uber on his phone. I say is XXX your address and he says yes. I say well someone used your phone to order a ride you need to go in the app and cancel it if you don't want it. He barks back I don't have the app on my phone and he is going to end the call. I hear a beep and think he ends the call. I go to cancel and I hear in the back ground that he is yelling at someone for ordering a ride too soon.

At that point I say screw it I need a break and gas anyway I'll leave the ride open and wait for him to cancel.

I go get gas, go to a fast food place and use the facility, BS with the manager a few minutes, fill my water cup and head out back on the road. See the ride is still active on my phone. Decide to drive by the place and a car is pulling out so I sneak through the gate. I get close enough to the house to start the timer counting down. Around the 4 minute mark I see another Uber/Lyft car pull up to the house. Pick the PAX up and head off.

I myself was assaulted by a young college student drunk girl. I dropped her boyfriend off anf they were repeat customers of mine and they always got matched up with me when I was nearby. All of a sudden as we were driving at night in the rich Edina homes area, she grabs me from behind my seat and she isn't aware she is choking me and I can't even talk while at same time she pressed her face with smelly melted makeup hard against my cheek as she says ""I hope you get mad p**** tonight"" and i tried removing her arm off my adams apple as she was constricting my airflow and me blacking out means we will end up crashing into some million dollar home.

The fight or flight adrenaline rush kicked in and I had to go SSJ2 with more blood flow to my muscles just to get her large arm off of me. I thought to myself is this German genetics or were womem always this strong?.

I spared her of calling police on her as I didn't wanna ruin her future with a criminal record because she was drunk and didn't know she was endangering myself and herself and stuff outside the car in event of accident. I warned her but with her drunkenness, she didn't even listen to me. 

In another incident an upscale looking man with golf shirt tucked in and looking like a father of your average college students. When we got on the freeway he asks me if I am sending the drug dealers to assassinate him. I offered to kick him out but he apologized so I dropped him off anyways. He was maybe methhead.

In another case in an upscale condo ping, I picked up an Engineer who looked like a young Robert Redford, and we had a couple stops 1 being the gas station and other being his girlfriend house.

When we got to his girlfriend house and parked right in front of it on street where she can even see us if so she checked her large house windows, I noticed the guy wasn't getting out then after a while he asks me ""Can I ask you something (fill in my name here)"" then I replied ""man it doesn't sound good if you have to ask me if it's ok if you wanna ask me something"".

Then he says, ""Can I suck your D quick""? Where D is you know what. I then replied ""your girlfriend house is right there and can see us"" then he asks again and I reply can you just go to your girlfriend? Then he asks again and I start opening my door and he gets scared and exists finally. 

All these incidents are just with 4k rides I had. There are tons of drivers with 20k rides. Imagine what they have seen and experienced. 

When I come back to Uber driving I will so get custom aftermarket bp glass shielding around my car seat separating me from front and rear sitting Pax. No law against it. Plus shootings happen in twin cities where I drove.

It's a crazy workd out there. You guy remember what that Walmart girl did to that Uber driver when she slashed him up to death.

Back to that girl who choked me, in the days following her assault, I noticed increased fat burning and more muscle definition on myself and thought to myself ""I think the body thinks theres danger nearby always now that I survived that incident and body is favouring fitness now for survival lol""",2021
post-7055056,rich5371,"Apr 25, 2021 at 7:19 PM","Last night I picked up a passenger from a Hospital Emergency Room entrance; he was escorted out by a big burly sheriff's deputy and two hospital orderlies (big men). The passenger was behaving a bit odd from the start and I didn't feel good about taking him, but I didn't feel like I could ask him to get out of the car at that point. Big lesson learned.
His destination was 9 miles away, and he was bouncing off the sides of the vehicle the whole way, throwing trash out the window, sounding like he was gagging and possibly spitting, I just held my breadth and told myself we would be at the destination and it would be over soon. We got to the destination and he was laying down on the floor across the passenger and driver area, and he would not get out of the car. After nearly 10 minutes I had no choice but to call 911. He started spitting at things all over the car, bringing up mucus and real nasty spit. After 20 minutes of waiting, he started to make like a tent in the back seat with his shirt, and I'd had enough. I opened up the back door again and told him that was it, he had to get out of my vehicle. He lunged up between the seats into the front, grabbed my bag of personal items and my cell phone and tried to get away. I body slammed him back and he dropped the phone and bag. He was pushed back into the car in that exchange, and I put my head in and convinced him if he didn't get out it would be bad for him. He opened the passenger side door, got out and walked away. As soon as he was no longer in site the Sheriff deputy showed up. I told the deputy what happened and the direction the guy left in. The glass back of my Samsung S9+ was shattered, the deputy asked if I wanted to file a report on it and I said no, not right then. Maybe later. I reached out to Uber and escalated the situation to a supervisor. They are ""glad I'm not hurt"", won't do anything about the spit (no pictures, I wiped the nastiness up with a towell), and offered me $15.00 for my destroyed phone. I sent pictures of the phone along with the receipt. I buy phones outright, it was $550.00. I can't press charges because I can't get the passengers information. I can only imagine one of my adult daughters being put in this situation.

When I asked him how much he owed, his answer shocked me. The pax said he owed over $12,000! I thought he meant $1200. But he said he just kept on ignoring the fines until the fines multiplied...all the while running even more tolls and having them multiply. I am not sure how the fines multiply, but I am guessing it was not a simple ""doubling"" like overdue parking tickets.

She told me that she hated law school and found it to be super dry, boring, and tedious. I picked her up from a bar around Mount Prospect, IL.

I found it fascinating because as I wrote there seems to be a definite trend, how many young people are seeking to build a career in the world of social media. They are shunning traditional careers and trying hard to carve their own path. Many guys are trying to sell merchandise online, and produce music. Many young ladies are trying to make it in the world of fashion and cooking. She says she is actively advertising her Instagram account and trying to build up a large following.

I've even had pax going out on the town and even a few tourists, unheard of since the beginning of the pandemic. More importantly, in the two weeks that I've been back to pax, a handful are actually tipping! 😂 

But, here's the downside. I've had ridiculously long distances to pick up pax, loads of ""scheduled"" trips, and TONS of dead miles / tolls. 118+ miles for about $85 has been the norm. 

Every day since I fired up X, it has been the same - start the trip, immediately bombarded with pings. Most are crap. I have to sign in again at least six times a day after getting the boot. Why? Because nobody is out driving! 

I fired up the Uber pax app yesterday, the only ants were hopelessly sitting at the airport.

I got my phone out, took the pictures and then sent them in to Uber with the damage report. I then got the gloves and paper towels out and blotted and dried the stain as much as possible. A few hours later the stain had almost gone, just leaving a faint outline ring. At the end of the night I did the usual routine of Lysol and water cleaning of the seat (have to clean the entire seat base to not leave water stains). It took about 10 minutes to clean.

Anyway, I though that Uber would give me 20 bucks. The next morning they emailed me to tell me that they had charged the pax $150. In contrast to Uber's lowball cleaning fees of late (I recently got just 40 bucks for puke on the car), $150 was too much for this stain.

At least it would get me back to the city. The ping only said ""premium pickup possible"" with a $2 surge.

Driving there, I saw that it was a hospital pick up for a patient. These have been prevalent lately, especially at JenCare Senior Clinics. I did not think much of it, usually they're fairly short, but a tip is out of the question because they're booked by a third party. 

I pull up, patient is wheeled to my car, and belongings are put in the trunk. Then I slide ""start"". 

198 mile trip. Already hungry and tired, EZ Pass running low, and no compensation for 190+ miles to get home. 

I turn to the door to hopefully grab the staff, they vanished into thin air. Called from the app, went to the patient. 

Apologized to him profusely and escorted him to a bench in front of the door. I tried to explain that he would need to tell the hospital that he needed another car and to let the driver know in advance that it was an extremely long trip. He did not seem to understand that, but did understand why I had to cancel. 

Medical staff and patients often seems to think that all we do is medical transport if we pick up at a hospital or clinic. They do not understand that we're Joe Regular Uber Driver. 

And it's very frustrating, especially after years of doing actual medical transport - including trips such as this, but being paid almost $30/hr regardless of dead miles, driving a vehicle that doesn't belong to me, and not paying for fuel or tolls.

But as the taxi industry in my city evaporated, one of my major critics wisely decided to switch over too. He turned in his leased cab, bought a little Chevy four-door, and signed up with Lyft (but  Uber for some reason).

He did Lyft for a couple of weeks - enjoyed the money-in versus expenses-out. This past Monday, I texted him and asked how his weekend went? ""Great!"" he said. ""I made $315 on Saturday and Sunday."" I thought that was pretty good, because Saturday was so rainy that I didn't even drive. Then he added, ""But I made all of that delivering food. I don't even do Lyft anymore. Too much driving!""

And there you have it. Uber and Lyft could not have predicted the rise in food-delivery services, and the need for them during this pandemic (which will continue). Bottom Line: Food delivery drivers make more money with less miles driven. They stay local, and don't go on any long trips like I did today:  trips over to Alabama with a deadhead back because I cannot take Uber  Lyft trips trips in Alabama.

I strongly suspect that more and more R/S drivers are switching to food for the same reason(s) as my friend.

I started X again when Eats had technical issues and customer tips fell sharply. At the same time, a driver buddy began doing X in the same market, brand spanking new.

While he's staying roughly in the same area (from my understanding), I'm getting TONS of ridiculous pings - awful ratings, long distance to pick up, and nothing remotely near the city (which has had consistant surges).

110 miles today, rounding up to four hours online (went offline for about 20 minutes hoping to get trips in the city), untold how many unpaid tolls, and I made $68.

The driver shortage is definitely a factor right now (see ""PLEASE DRIVE"") but it also appears that the algorithm is leaning towards brand new drivers like my buddy (well established on Eats, brand new to X) and giving me the bird.

post-7021149,Young Kim,"Apr 11, 2021 at 4:06 PM","Had a pickup in downtown Chicago by the Hotel Intercontinental going to Scores Bar (a strip club), 30 minutes westbound. The pax asked if he could play DMX through my bluetooth. DMX is somewhat before the rappers I love like Wiz Khalifa, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, and Cardi B....but... when we listened to it, I was happily surprised by his gritty style, very ""real"" lyrics. The next ride from Scores brought me to the west side of Chicago and then the south side.

So I listened to him all night, and as I mentioned, once you get to the west or south side of Chicago, you don't often leave the area. This is because many drivers will avoid the area or log off once they drop off there. Therefore, if you get to the area and leave on the app, you will stay there all night. Many pax who came in were so excited and happy that an Asian would enjoy hip hop/ rap/ R&B, and congratulated me on my musical tastes.

I spoke to pax all night regarding DMX, his turbulent life, and his very depressing death. One young lady pax I spoke to said that DMX reminded her of her family a great deal... a very high functioning drug user. She talked about how her father uses PCP casually and does a good job to help the community and other people. She said that drug users should not be stereotyped as criminals. The young lady emphasized that once you demonize drugs and make it illegal, it glamorizes it and makes rebellious young people get into it more and more.

Pax talked about how music unifies and brings the world together, and DMX the rapper made incredible music. One pax kept using the word, GOAT, as an acronym to describe DMX (G=Greatest, O=Of, A=All, T=Time). It was amazing to see the impact that the death of a legendary rapper had on a community like Chicago. After my shift, I watched some of DMX's acting jobs with Jet Li... like in Cradle2Grave and Romeo Must Die. He was a very talented person!

post-7006439,Seamus,"Apr 7, 2021 at 10:18 AM","Like many, I started Ubering and was as naive as could be. Uber just became legal in NY (outside NYC) in July of 2017 and because it was brand new both pax and drivers were trying to figure it all out.

Shortly after starting to Uber I started lurking in the UP forum for awhile before joining. It was somewhat of a different forum back then, more like a band of pirates giving tips on how to make more money and strategizing to beat Uber. Back then, Uber's AI was no where near as good as it is today and a driver had a much easier time manipulating the ""system"" to maximize revenue. Now forget it, Uber's AI is too good to beat except in rare circumstances.

I started reading in UP about longhauling, Shirlington Shuffling (deliberately not intending to give a ride) and creating surges. (Yes, believe it or not you used to be able to create surges)! I thought I would never do any of that in a million years. After dealing with Uber and pax BS, boy did that change! In the interest of space I'll just choose one (although I've done them all)



I thought it was terrible that a driver would deliberately boost up a fare, then I met ""Karen"". I took ""Karen"" on a 1.5x surge to JFK Airport in NYC from the northern suburbs. At a 1.5x surge with higher rates that was a very decent fare. Karen immediately became one of the most annoying pax I ever gave a ride to. She was a visitor to NY from Chicago and immediately started pounding and pounding what a terrible place NY was. Next, she found out that I was born in Scotland and spent the next 15 minutes telling me how bad Scotland was and that it was one of the ""worse places on the face of the earth"". She was crass, obnoxious, and extremely rude! The final straw was her telling me how ""blatantly stupid"" most Uber drivers were. That was it. OK Karen, we are going to JFK by way of Long Island!!! :roflmao:. If you look at my route it looked like a very pregnant line. FU Karen!

Do you remember your first deliberate shuffle, longhaul, throwing a pax out, etc .etc.? Something you thought you'd never do?",2021

Honestly I have never seen numbers like these back in the days when I was transporting human cargoes around. Do you set a weekly target? For me, it is $200 to pay for car insurance and phone bills. Sometimes, the numbers are so unreal that if I am able to make, say $500 by working a little harder, that would worth a month of car payment. Is this why there are so many brand new cars and even nicer luxury cars with Uber stickers?







While these numbers may appear as a child's play to some here on the forum, personally I do feel satisfied with the extra $ every week.

My pax said his life was going very well, and he had a good job. No problems. Then his girlfriend made him very upset and treated him like trash. He started taking care of her totally and completely... emotionally and financially. He was so devastated, that he decided the best way to get back at her was to send her pictures of him shooting up heroin. He thought that doing so would make her feel terrible, and he would get even and in a way revenge.

Unfortunately, it resulted with him getting addicted to heroin and getting arrested for drug possession. He is undergoing treatment now. We had one stop on the ride, and I am very much of the impression that he was picking up drugs (likely heroin). The pax is not sure how much guilt he caused his girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend), because they stopped talking... I'm thinking those videos was not a wise move on his part. (I often disable my dashcam because pax will not talk if they know they are on camera. Therefore, I just record the audio on my phone, and make sure to keep my pax anonymous).

Here is the audio/video. He cried a lot after the video clip cut off. He could not believe that his girlfriend would take him for granted after he treated her like a princess.

post-7020811,Young Kim,"Apr 11, 2021 at 1:53 PM","Picked up a young lady pax south of downtown Chicago around 1:30 am, and heard her talking to a guy in a hushed voice on the phone, ""So you got what I need?, because I got the money..."" She talked price on the phone and then hung up. We then started talking, and she said she was going deeper into the south side of Chicago to ""complete a deal"". She clutched her large purse and counted cash. I thought for sure it was something else, but I found out that she had human hair wigs in her purse.

She said this when I asked her how she is managing the pandemic with all the uncertainty in employment for everyone (This is one of my standard pax questions). She said, like many young pax, that she was self-employed, and bought and sold hair weaves and wigs. She explained that all her products come straight from Asia. She said, ""It comes from your countries, China, Korea, and India."" 

She said that the best hair and prices come from the East. She buys them from a secret source and then resells them. This is why she feels the need to hide them from law enforcement. ""Human hair"" wigs are not by themselves illegal, but she felt that if law enforcement somehow discovered the source, she could get into trouble (sort of like having cartons of cigarettes which escaped duty/ U.S. Customs/ tax)

When I asked her if I could see one, she looked behind us and around first, said, ""Well, I don't see any police, so here is one"". She showed me a few, and some were weaves and some were wigs (which one was dyed blond and brown). They looked very nice and high quality to me. The pax described her business, which was booming.

She said that there are smugglers of vast amounts of human hair which are often obtained illegally. She said that in some Asian countries, ladies have their long hair cropped off against their will, sometimes in cases of religious sacrifice (like when a ""holy"" leader will tell the lady that to show her love and devotion to a god, then she must demonstrate a sacrifice...like her long hair. (Which the religious leader will then sell). 

I didn't really know this illegal, but I guess the young lady knew that she cannot be in possession of large quantities of it. This puzzled me, because I know many wigs are made with real human hair, and I had no idea this would be illegal. She really acted like she had bags of illicit substances in her purse, which was my first guess. I am guessing that while a person can have maybe one of two wigs for personal use, if someone has many many such hair pieces, then it may not be permitted if it was determined that such products were smuggled into the U.S.? 

I suppose I found this pax ride interesting, because she told me that up to 90% of young ladies on the south and west sides of Chicago have wigs and hair extensions! I thought that young ladies just straighten their hair and then carefully take hours to ""weave"" them or braid them by hand. But my pax explained that almost always you are looking at a wig, not their natural hair. 

Then she surprised me by pulling up her own beautiful weave to reveal... a nearly bald shaved head! She said her ethnicity's hair ""frizzes"" so easily, especially in moisture, so it is far easier to have very very short hair and then just put on a wig / weave. The pax explained that she makes a very good living buying, creating, styling, human hair from the Asian countries, and there is a massive never ending market at least here in Chicago.",2021
post-6939587,Young Kim,"Mar 16, 2021 at 4:27 PM","Driving through this pandemic this past year I've had multiple customers complain that they could not get a Lyft ride. Since 1 year ago, as month after month passed, pax would often tell me that they tried to get a Lyft first because it was cheaper but the wait times got longer and longer.

Some of them were hardcore Lyft loyalists, but they have been telling me that around the new year it got really bad with wait times being over 45 minutes at least in Chicago. But recently they said they could not even get one at all! It would say ""Lyfts are unavailable in your area."" Or something like that..

A couple of customers last night told me that they are worried because they think that once Uber finishes off Lyft they're going to jack up the fares even more because then Uber will be a complete total monopoly and they can set the prices wherever they want. Many Uber ants have both apps up.

post-6967959,Cvillegordo,"Mar 25, 2021 at 9:23 PM","As if I needed a reason to make this a personal practice, another 3rd party ride disaster happened last night. 

Just before pickup, text from pax; ""you will be picking up Anton, a friend of mine. He is going to the hospital, his sister just died.""

Ok.

Anton (I assumed) was a disheveled black male of indeterminate age, as I pulled up to the house he was attempting to park a bicycle on it's kickstand. Ok. I waited until he finally gave up and leaned the bike against the house. 

""UBER?""

Yeah. Hop in.

Anton approaches with no mask and a bag of chips. 

You need a mask, and no eating in the car. 

""No problem.""

Puts on mask, rolls chips up into a ball and gets in. Off we go. 

""We need to stop at a church. I'm from Charlottesville, I'll show you where to go.""

Realizing that he didn't order the ride, asking him to put in a stop is pointless, so I ask which church. It's on the way, no biggie. Then he starts giving me directions, loudly, leaning forward towards the front, mask drooping below his chin. I realize he is very intoxicated. The directions turn into excited shouts; ""TURN HERE! NO, THERE! LISTEN TO ME!""

We stop at the church. I turn and say; ""you will not shout at me, and you will wear your mask if you want a ride."" He gets out, leaves the door open and goes to the church door where there are several packages. All the while shouting obscenities at someone on his phone. This all happened in the space of a minute or less. I look in the back seat, chips and crumbs everywhere. F.uck this. I jump out, close the door, toss his chips on the street. End trip, drive away. I hear him bellowing curses for two blocks. One star, call support to document.

post-6999219,Young Kim,"Apr 5, 2021 at 5:49 AM","I drove up to a strip club in Stone Park, IL called ""The Gold Room"" (all purple lights outside), and picked up two guys and drove them into downtown Chicago this past Saturday night around 3:00 am. They came in mildly drunk but were incredibly happy. I remarked to them that I was surprised the strip clubs were open again because I had heard they had closed due to covid. The guy behind me told me, ""No man, they reopened. I was so excited that I slapped each of the girls in the as# tonight thanking each of them for getting back to work.""

On the way to downtown, one of the guys became very chatty and started talking a LOT about aliens and how he feels that they either created this world as a 3-D simulation and we are all living in a video game...or they are behind the scenes controlling it completely by assuming key behind the scenes roles. He went so far as to suggest that there are large underground military bases where the world leaders are collaborating with some alien races who wish to study humans. 

I could tell that he had studied a lot into this area, and he mentioned a lot of details about stories he read about famous UFO/alien sightings. Once in a while, his friend would chime in, and say that aliens must exist as there are endless worlds and universes out there. He then discussed how we are all sort of living in a human ""ant farm"" like environment where everything is controlled, and all variables altered to see how humans would react.

When he asked me my opinion on all this, I replied I can agree that there very well could be aliens, but until they show up and affect my life directly I am not interested. I told them that it is cool to ponder, but since I cannot prove or disprove their existence right now, it is not practical for me to think about it. After, he asked me if I had seen any. I told him no. He said he did see some before looking at the night sky with a telescope, and he saw some when he experimented with DMT, a powerful psychedelic drug. 

The ride ended though in sort of a funny way. About 2 minutes from our destination, the more quiet guy sitting on my passenger side rear suddenly ask me to drive faster because he had to go to the bathroom ASAP. I told him that I cannot risk getting a ticket, but if it is an emergency, I can pull over. He said fine and then he would be OK. Then, with about 30 seconds left, he screamed at me, ""Pull over, pull over now, right NOW!"" 

So I stopped quickly, and he got out and then his friend who was talking about all the alien stuff went out and both relieved themselves for a long while by a building wall. After, they both got back in, and the guy on the right said, ""Dude, that was such a relief, thanks a bunch, I am gonna tip you $30 on the app ok!""

If you're in the area and you like good Italian, check out Tavola. Last night I had a pickup at Tavola; ""JaNAYzha"" with a 4.3 rating. $5 promotion and $2 surge, short ride, why not? (Rhetorical question.) These restaurants are literally side by side, if you stop at one, you're there. Stopped at the PIN, texted the rider, waited 2 minutes and received a text; ""you're at the wrong address."" WTF.

post-6999173,Young Kim,"Apr 5, 2021 at 4:51 AM","My first pax of this Sunday night was a guy I drove from Glenview, IL to downtown Chicago. He previously worked in the advertising business but was laid off due to covid. Now, he just started trying to make a living rehabbing houses and flipping them. On the long ride (35 minutes), we talked about a lot of things but mostly he complained about Uber and Lyft these days. He said that he and his friends were ""die hard rideshare loyalists"", but recently he started souring on both companies.

For example, he said that tonight (Easter Sunday), he could not get a Lyft or an Uber for over an hour until I accepted the ride. I drove 15 minutes to pick him up. Before I accepted the ride, he said that both Uber and Lyft told him some message like, ""No drivers in your area, try again soon"" or ""Are you sure you wish to request, limited available cars""...something like that. He was so grateful that I finally picked him up, because he was just about to give up. He told me, ""If you hadn't come, then I would have had to stay overnight with my ex-wife, so thank from the bottom of my heart for that!"" 

He mentioned the ridiculous surge. Lately, he said the prices for both Uber and Lyft were equal or sometimes a lot more than what a taxi used to be. And.... there were no more quick pickup times (5 minutes or less) that he was used to for rideshare. Now, just like the taxi industry before, he would often wait up to an hour (as he was in the suburbs), for an Uber or Lyft to show...or ""none available""...just like the taxis.

Therefore, he voiced active hope that the taxi industry would get themselves back together to shape and make a valiant comeback. We discussed how the Chicago medallions were a high of $385,000 back in 2013. Now, there is no bid... (no buyers). So he hoped that now that the prices are so incredibly low, there could be a chance for the ""left for dead"" taxicab companies to make a comeback...and wished eagerly for them to make an effort.

This got me thinking...

I was actually far happier for a multitude of reasons driving a taxi (part time I drove for Flash Cab and other companies) than driving rideshare for two very evil companies... I felt I had very more control over my destiny driving a cab. Plus, I paid zero attention to whether my car would depreciate, not have to worry that I could be ""deactivated"" for a nonsense complaint, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

post-6997069,Aw Jeez,"Apr 4, 2021 at 11:47 AM","In another thread, Benjamin M talks about how few drivers seem to be out there. Seems that way here in my town too (Pensacola, FL). A lot of people have suggested reasons - and maybe some of them are valid. Here's what I know...

I turn the Lyft app on first because it's less ""fussy"" than the stupid Uber app. (""Take a picture of yourself."" Then, ""Now take a picture with your mask on."" And then, ""Now give us a urine sample."" It never ends!) Before I can even get Uber up and running, the Lyft app is sending me a trip. From that point on, it's go-go-go, stacked pings all day for as long as I want to drive. Yes, some of them are for far-away pickups and I decline as many of them as I can. Many days I don't even log-on to Uber.

I hear from a lot of passengers that they have loooong wait times, and sometimes they get a message that no cars are available. Damn! I had one passenger tell me how hard it was for him to get a driver to pick him up, as he was enthusiastically thanking me for coming to get him. I said, ""Well, it *is* my job, dude."" And he goes, ""No, no. One driver told me that he doesn't do passengers anymore, he primarily just does food. Says there's more money in it."" And I thought: Maybe that's why the passenger apps have been so busy these days - drivers are switching to food so they don't have to deal with...you know...people? May be... Maybe if I was in this for the money, I'd deliver food instead too.

People in general are becoming more and more dependent on ride-share to get around, even in the suburbs where there are typically fewer drivers. Lyft and Uber like to send you (meaning: me) all over hell for pickups. Given the option, I don't accept an Uber or Lyft ping that's over 12 minutes away. But Lyft is sneaky - they'll slide a new ride in when you've just begun the first one. I keep the volume on my phone down, so I don't always hear the, ""New standard ride added to queue"" announcement. 

I used to work six hours a day to make my ""target"" revenue. Now I do it in four or five. So I'm kind of with Benjamin M here. I kind of wish there were more drivers out in my town. It's F-ing busy here. And my fear is that the less-satisfied people become with ride-share, the more they'll gravitate back to taxis.",2021

post-6982025,Young Kim,"Mar 30, 2021 at 4:34 PM","In the past week I had at least three pax that told me that they are taking matters into their own hands and not going back to school (or not going to college). last night I picked up a pax at Dave & Buster's in Rosemont Illinois and he was upset that his college experience is being ruined because of covid. He is also irked because Northern Illinois University is not dramatically lowering his tuition costs. Therefore he is dropping out and he is going to try to learn how to program and design video games. He mentioned to me that he doesn't think school has anything like that he cannot learn on his own.

Another student I picked up yesterday was a 3rd-year student from a city college who also was feeling that he can make a lot more money doing things on his own than what he is learning at school. He felt that being an entrepreneur is far better than trying to work for a corporation in the future. He told me last night that he bought three used cars at auction last night and he will fix them up and resell them. He was super excited, and he talked all about how much profit he'd be making.

There was a third guy that just graduated from New Trier high School which is a highly regarded school where a lot of rich kids go to. That ride was about two nights ago and I remember he lived in Winnetka, Illinois which is a very affluent suburb. He was making a lot of money buying premium sneakers from online and in the north side and then he would drive to the south and the west side and sell them to inner city teenagers. He described that he could buy the sneakers himself for about $150 and turn around some of them to some of the teenagers the inner city for $400. He felt that he could make it his full time job after he finishes high school in a couple of months. He showed me his Instagram account where he showed off all of his shoes in his inventory.

I Ieel like at least this could be the start of a trend where a lot of young college age students are feeling that the very high cost of a college education is no longer worth it and doesn't add value. I feel like I've seen a trend at least myself where young college age passengers are telling me that they plan to take matters into their own hands.",2021
post-6988807,The Gift of Fish,"Apr 1, 2021 at 5:18 PM","There are a two points of view regarding post-your-boast earnings threads in which people post their earnings in various levels of detail; posting summaries only, providing full breakdowns of individual trips, or anything and everything in between. Some people say that posting earnings guides to one's own market is foolish. Others, judging by the number of them on here, think that they are great. My own opinion is that they certainly are foolish. However, they have also benefitted me, which seems contradictory. Here is my experience.

Late last year I was browsing this forum when I noticed a post-your-boast thread. ""It's HOPPING in my town"", posted the OP, who went on to describe in detail the goings-on in his local market. He had posted a screenshot of the driver app screen of his latest weekly earnings broken down by day, and also screenshots of several individual rides showing the spots that the rides originated, along with the day, date, time and value of each one.

""This is interesting"", I thought. The area advertised by the earnings boaster is a smallish community around 40 miles outside a major metro area in California, which I knew vaguely. I have friends who live very close to it whom I hadn't seen in a while, plus things had been very slow in the Bay Area. I had also felt like taking a little vacation. So I decided to go and visit, and combine a vacation with a chance to make some good money. I had never driven rideshare there but my plan was simple. I would just go to the spots identified by the OP on the days and times advertised by him, turn on the driver app and wait.

And so it happened. One road trip later, I went to the first staging area, turned the app on and waited. Things turned out to be just as the OP had said. Demand was excellent and I soon bagged some great high-dollar rides, and a couple of very high dollar rides. Over the next week I was very pleased with the results. Interestingly, during this time, I picked up the same passenger three times from her house was a couple of miles from where I was staying, indicating that there were few drivers in the area. This, coupled with the nice surges and excellent ping quantity, was evidence of a very favourable demand:driver ratio in the area.

Now, back to the question posed above, regarding whether post-your-boast is a good idea, for both the poster and for me. Let's find the answer with simple cost:benefit analyses. If the benefits outweigh the costs then we'll say that it was a good result, and if benefits do not outweigh the costs, we'll say that it was not a good result.

For me, the costs of the exercise were gas to get to and from the poster's location, and the earnings I did not make in the Bay Area. The benefits were the earnings I made in his area, which exceeded the gas cost and my foregone home earnings by a country mile. So, for me, it was a good result.

For the OP, it's hard to estimate the costs of me working his area. When I accepted the pings there, I obviously denied those rides to all other drivers in the area. Was the driver one of those drivers? Was he working the area on the days and times I was? There's no way to tell. All we know is that it was possible. It's also possible that I was not the only driver attracted into his area by his advertising. Now, let's look at the other side of the analysis - the benefit side to him of advertising his area. This can be summed up as zero. In dollar terms, $0. Nada. As we said above, if the benefits outweigh the costs, then it is a positive result. However, with a benefit of zero, the benefits of advertising one's own area on a public forum can never, by defintion, outweigh the cost. The cost being, of course, the risk of losing business to competitors that one attracted into the area.

In summary, advertising one's area in post-your-boast threads is foolish, but the magnitude of the foolishness depends on the level of detail given. At the top of the tree, we have posting exact hotspots together with the days of the week and times to get good rides there. This will result in immediate competition from other drivers turning up. Further down the list of self-scuppering is the posting of daily earnings totals and the general location of the earnings. While one does not divulge the exact locations and times of the opportunities, it is still persuasive in attracting drivers, both old and new, into one's area. With zero benefit for the poster boaster, it is hard to see how this is a good idea. As seen above, there is no benefit to it for the advertiser. However, for the driver looking for new opportunities and areas to drive in, or for existing drivers who have taken a break and are considering returning to rideshare in their town, these posts can be golden eggs.

Conclusion - keep posting them, please! Just don't do it in my area. :thumbup:",2021
post-6982107,Young Kim,"Mar 30, 2021 at 5:00 PM","This was a first for me... after about 15,000 rides with Uber: a passenger this past Saturday night around 3:30 a.m. who I picked up from the city and brought for a long ride westbound began talking about how he was a Sicario (hitman) for the Sinaloa cartel. The conversation went in this direction when we talked about what colleges we went to. And we started on the topic of colleges because he had mentioned that I seemed so articulate. I told him I went to the University of Chicago and he lit up with enthusiasm and we talked about economics. He just said matter of factly that after college he unfortunately went to jail for several years because he shot somebody right next to his heart.

I picked up 49 seconds of the conversation but I stopped it after he began to go into great detail and told me his name and the person that he had shot. Obviously I stopped the video at that point. Here is the 49-second clip below which protects his anonymity:


after he told me that he had shot somebody and gone to jail and told me to look up his name on Google. I did so quickly at the next traffic light and indeed it was my passenger and I saw his mugshot. He then told me about how he had been to a couple of state prisons and told me about the life inside prison. Somehow he got out after several years.

He befriended some people with the cartel while inside prison when he was in jail. After leaving jail, he said he started to work for them. When I asked him why he did that because I told him it was so dangerous he said that the money is so good. Also he told me that the women are so plentiful that he has no problem finding beautiful young women all the time. He showed me on his phone at a couple of lights where we were stopped him posing with many beautiful women and him describing that he had been with all of them.

I think he could sense that I didn't quite believe his story (at first) and the reason that I was a little skeptical was honestly I thought to myself that if someone is actively killing somebody why would they tell some total random stranger?

Then he said, ""I could sense that you doubt me so let me show you..."". ""look!"". And then when I turned around he produced what he said was a loaded handgun. I did get scared at first but then I calmed down and then just asked him to put it away. He kept on asking me if I was wearing a wire. He also kept asking me if I wanted to take a bump of cocaine in the car. Naturally I said no to both. I told him that I would never use drugs under any circumstance and especially never while I was driving Uber.

I thought if I should try to get help while I was in the ride I figured it would not be a good idea to antagonize somebody in the situation that I was in. I quickly looked at the name on my app and it was not the name of my passenger. So I thought to myself if something were to happen then there wouldn't be any way to necessarily track him.

So I just stayed calm and listened to him tell stories of people that he's killed. They were both targets in Mexico and the US. He said he particularly asks for pedophiles and women beaters. Tell me about the fees that he collects and they're usually between three and $5,000 in the US. The most he got was $25,000. He described that there was a code of course of no women no children... however there were some unusual circumstances where things like that were allowed.

then he went into some graphic detail and asked me if I ever saw somebody's head getting cut off. I remember him also asking me if I ever saw several ks of cocaine live right in front of me. Then he told me about the time that he saw somebody get drawn and quartered by five different cars. Like they would tie each limb and the head to five different cars and then drive in different directions. It went into more graphic detail about people being boiled alive and many other things I won't go into.

it almost seemed like he was telling me his autobiography because he told me about names locations places he's done hits...I was extremely utterly surprised that he would go into such detail with somebody he did not know.

Anyway the ride ended and like I said I stayed very very calm and collected and I didn't report it to Uber or anything else. In fact he told me that the name on the account was just someone untraceable so I wouldn't even need to bother. Besides he told me that I could tell someone his story but I couldn't use any personal details... and I did not here. He did very calmly tell me it would be a shame that someone so cool and smart like me would suddenly disappear.

I wanted to share the story because it was highly unusual and it was probably the very first time while driving a passenger that I felt a little tingle of fear. I did not embellish or exaggerate even a single detail of the story here.

So this week I picked up a pax who just clocked off a 12 hour shift and was going to his girlfriend's place....he asked me if I ""wouldn't mind"" going to the drive thru liquor store so he could bring over a 6-pack. 

These are the kinds of overtures I ALWAYS turn down (because it opens up a portal of time wastage and drama)...I was about to say ""no sorry"" but then glanced through my mirror at this guy who had gotten off his shift and just wanted to relax with his woman and beer, and I thought...I can do it just this one. 

We stop at the drive thru liquor store, he orders his 6-pack but ""can't find his ID"" and the cashier won't make an exception for him... he's really frustrated and tells me ""hey, lets just get outta here"", so I put the car in drive, but then again look at through the mirror at him, pause, put the car in park, call the cashier back and say ""I'm ordering what he just ordered"".

The pax passed a $20 up to the front seat, I pay and try give him the 6-pack and this change, and says ""no mann, just keep it"".

I dropped the pax off...drove off and realized I had unwittingly performed a random act of kindness toward a pax.",2021
post-6946705,Young Kim,"Mar 18, 2021 at 4:18 PM","My last pax of the night I found particularly interesting because her story was unique. She had found a sugar daddy. I picked her up around the Edison Park Illinois area and brought her to the DoubleTree hotel in downtown Chicago. We got to talking and I asked her how the pandemic has affected her.

She told me that it was pretty rough when the pandemic started because she had been working at McCormick place as one of those young women who are hired to promote displays. it's a business convention center and frequently they hire young ladies to cater to the businessmen who are coming in and show off whatever company they're representing.

During one of the conventions an older gentleman had befriended her and they exchanged phone numbers somehow. After some communication they didn't talk for a little while. Once the pandemic struck, she lost all of her gigs at the convention center,... some of which paid her upwards of $38 per hour to basically stand there.

Is she contacted the older gentleman and they made an agreement. He would come into town and pay her visit in a hotel... and they would I guess be companions for the short time he was in Chicago. She actually has a young son that she must take care of so meeting him and him agreeing to be her supporter was quite fortunate for her.

I asked gently her if she enjoyed his company and the entire arrangement, and she seemed just okay with it. Like she didn't say that she really loved him or that she hated him or anything like that. For her it was just kind of a business arrangement to help her support herself and her young son. Of course she didn't tell me the amount, and obviously I didn't ask but she said that he sends her money every month

I thought this was interesting because during this pandemic people must cope in all sorts of different ways. She was actually the first person I met who actually had a real sugar daddy. she did tell me that he was happily married with children., But that did not bother her because of course that's not what she wanted because he was probably around 50 years old. I couldn't be sure but he actually came out to greet her cuz he was so excited, so I got to briefly see him.",2021

With the combination of multiple rate cuts, deteriorating passengers and the pandemic, I have decided to quit once and for all.

Recently I have been obsessed with deliveries, most of which are grocery shopping. At first it sounds ridiculous to me to be paid Uber rate to not only transport cargoes but also include the shopping component. Contrary to my expectation, this is very addicting. Don't be mistaken, I am not saying grocery shopping gigs are better than Ubering in any part. Although the base pay is about $6, consider the amount of time needed to complete one delivery, this is certainly not worth the effort without any incentives. What I mean by ""incentives"" are in nature, not the useless badges and ratings.

First, I love the upfront information about expected pay, time to completion and pick-up and drop-off locations, all of which we are supposed to be entitled to, not to be provided only if certain outrageous criteria are met. Here comes the best part, the monetary incentives. Depending on the local markets and time, the estimated payout (with bonus included) can be far more attractive than doing rides, not to mention you will have full control of where to end up after a delivery. Needless to say, how much we take home is also highly dependent on the willingness of customers to tip. However, if you are the type that withdraw every penny after each delivery, this may not work for you because there is a $500 cap. Personally I have no problem for these companies to keep the money for a year if there is a minimum of 1% interest rate &#128514;.




Finally, I am also astonished by the real time support. For instance, a transaction will be denied by default when customers request additional items after we accept an order. It only takes a minute or two for the support to override the payment authorization. They are also very helpful to assign a return for unsuccessful deliveries. Since not every store accepts return because of the pandemic, basically I have free food plus the $5 to drive back to the store. The only time that happened to me also include some adult products. Um may be I should consider selling them.",2021

He and his sister actually work in Chicago but they live in Gary Indiana, because he said that it was so much safer than living in the south side of Chicago where there is much more crime. We entered his suburb and I remember asking him ""how much do houses cost around here?""

I was stunned at his answer. He told me his house cost him only about $15,000 before closing costs last year. He said there was a slightly renovated one that was a few houses down that was $40,000. I was kind of in disbelief because his subdivision was not dilapidated or run down at all.

granted this was the night so I couldn't get a good look but there did not seem to be any trash or any boarded-up houses or lawns that seemed not well-maintained. It just looked like any other subdivision that you might find in Chicagoland. When I finished the ride I remember I went on redfin and verified that houses in his subdivision really were only about 15 to $40,000 in that area!

I just was so stunned that houses could be so cheap. this is before the pandemic but I remember I went on craigslist and I saw a parking space in river north Chicago which is in downtown Chicago selling for $55,000! And that was just a parking space! To be able to purchase a home for between 15 to $20,000 it just seems so incredible.

Indeed a 30-40-minute drive to downtown Chicago is not very close but if you can get a house for next to nothing,...well I can imagine why some people would choose to live out there.

An actual drunken leprechaunish Irishman hops in front -- a roofer. Ten minute drive to Upper Darby. Hes lit and loutish like the town drunk in early Irish novel, nearly incomprehensible. 

But two minutes in the ride he musters enough Anglish to ask if I can stop first at his dealers' place. Nah, man, nah, can't do it, the app will know, I lied. I drop him off and he tells me theres no cash brother I'll get you on the app (kiss of death). He then grabs me with his Krakken roofer destroyed hands and proceeds to pull me toward him (I'm 6'5 250) and I'm --- well --- what are you gonna do this guy says goodbye by touching foreheads; forcefully.

post-6957837,Fusion_LUser,"Mar 22, 2021 at 3:26 PM","I had a good Friday/Saturday evening last weekend and I was at home catching up on a book with the TV on when I got a ping for a long ride! My longest ride by far at 175+ miles. Before this request my longest ride was about 86 miles. I had been sitting at 3.5x starting around 3PM and did take a quick ride around 4PM for $38 but then Uber signed me out and forced me to take a selfie which I did. When I signed back in I forgot to change my fare multiplier so if I was at 3.5x who knows if I would have even got the 175+ mile ride... There were other ants available so I was surprised it came in at 2.1x. I guess the other ants didn't want the ride...

Anyway I saw the amount and did a quick screen shot then accepted the ride, thinking it was a high surge ride to Santa Barbara in the $300 range. It wouldn't be my first $300+ ride to Santa Barbara so I was OK with the blind accept. I then looked at the screen shot and saw it was to LA! Oh man, do I want to do this at 6PM on a Sunday???

So I go to The Boss who is prepping her lesson plan and for the next two minutes or so we talk about the ride...

I have a juicy $300 or more ride. Gotta go!
Where?
LA!
LA! Are you serious?
<mumbling> yes
You are going to LA at this time? You won't be back for hours!
It's gonna be like $50 an hour so why not?
CUZ IT'S LA!
Should I cancel?
It's up to you, that's a long ride. You are just watching TV so go, be safe!

After that nod of approval I did a quick bathroom break, grabbed a Rockstar and took off at 6:30PM. The pick up was near me in a newer part of town and a father/uncle/lover/pimp with his daughter/niece/lover/hooker was waiting for me. Just the lady got in my car and didn't speak one word of English. I confirmed the address with the guy and off we went. The lady fell asleep within 20 minutes and was slumped over in the back seat for about an hour and then just kept to herself in the backseat, it was like nobody was even there.

The ride was non-eventful until about 20 minutes from our destination. She took a speakerphone call in Chinese and then out the blue she just put her phone right up to my face! I could not see anything but the blue screen in my right eye! She said ""talk"" and the person on the phone was saying ""Hello?""... I took the phone, said hello and the person just wanted to confirm the drop-off. I said that's the place and that was that.

I did miss a turn in LA, it was dark and there was a lot of traffic so I had to do a U-Turn at a light and a guy waiting for her at a Chinese restaurant when we arrived at 9:15PM. Both said thanks and off they went. Uber paid over $317 and they gave a $60 tip. Not bad for the first 3 hours!

I was getting ping after ping for local rides anywhere from $2 (outrageous... who the hell drives for $2???) up to $20 but I didn't know the locations and I didn't want to go out of my way so I turned on the trip filter and I was still getting a lot of pings! I did see one 2.0x for $25 to $29 from Union Station to Studio City (about 17 miles) and took that. I got another ride at 1.8x for $44 ($24 plus $20 cash tip) from the Warner Center in Woodland Hills up to Calabasas that was not much out of the way at all. I got sporadic pings for the last 150 miles home that I ignored.

I get home at 12:45AM... 6 hours and 15 minutes total for the 3 rides and one bathroom stop in Ventura... 345 miles and just a little over $450 for doing the entire trip. I used about a half tank of gas... I started with a little over 3/4 and ended with a little less than a 1/4.

post-6945989,Young Kim,"Mar 18, 2021 at 12:52 PM","I had a pickup in Mount prospect Illinois with a pax named Margaret who was going to a bar in Schaumburg Illinois. Hers was a fascinating story about how covid changed her life and completely turned everything around.

She works currently for Comcast and is a technical support agent. She said that when the pandemic struck last year they offered everyone who worked a 25% bonus in their hourly salary. Then because of the pandemic she was promoted finally to being a manager.. with a big salary raise in addition to the 25% bump.

Then all the sudden she said she felt like she hit the jackpot because Comcast said that everyone could work remotely. She said that was such a relief because she said that initially her office was in Schaumburg then they moved her to oakbrook and then finally to Bolingbrook Illinois. Her commute times went from 12 minutes to 30 minutes to 1 hour when she finally got located to Bolingbrook Illinois. The commute was killing her because sometimes when there was traffic it would be an hour and a half back home..

she loved being able to just work from her pajamas because she doesn't even have to be seen since she's a technical support agent. Then recently she said that they introduced at Comcast a text support feature. that means she doesn't even have to be on the phone anymore with a headset! She said that was a godsend because she was sick and tired of having to continue to talk to customers who would ramble on and on. She didn't have to talk over them anymore. 

She said she could also listen to music which she said was a first while she was working. She would just blast music and then she'd be on video with friends just hanging out. Sometimes she would just go to friends homes and even restaurants and just do her work from there.

She also said that she had just recently bought a brand new car because her old one broke down. But because of the pandemic she said that she was able to sell her car to her friend who gave her a very good price. so now she no longer has a car payment or has to pay for any insurance and just takes Uber when she needs to go somewhere but she says it's not often.

She said with all the promotions in the bump up and pay and the incredibly relaxing work and being able to sell her car that her finances completely turned around. She told me that she's saving up so much money for extended vacations to Italy and France and all around the world. she said she could never save money before the pandemic. She just yesterday got her third stimulus bonus by direct deposit as well.

She admitted that she feels terrible about this because she's knows a lot of people have gotten sick and died and she feels guilty about admitting to anybody how she feels. but she admitted to me that she's had a hard life and after years and years of difficult times, the universe finally rewarded her personally with the pandemic... She said her life was now better than ever. Better than it's ever been in her entire life. I've had a lot of pandemic stories that were somewhat positive in the last year but this one blew all the others out of the water...",2021

Stopped in the shitter lot at the airport to have lunch, because I just dropped a pax off for his flight. Dude parks beside me and walks over......checking out my vehicle body and then asking me for my documents. Of course my ""tax receipts"" were in order  so I talked to the guy for about 10 minutes before he left.

I asked him and he said he easily busts 1-2 drivers a day just by cruising into the waiting area at random. It's a big ticket too he said. Also, a lot of vehicles with evident body damage get their TNC licence pulled on the spot if they get caught. That is also as frequent according to him. He drives thru there 4-6 times a day according to a couple of the drivers I talked to after he left. My math tells me that about 3-400 Uber drivers are on the roads in our market over 24 hours at some point, so the number seems pretty low overall.

These dudes also told me that wait times are 2 - 2.5 hours for a ride right now. Why the **** do they sit there ? Max $ run to the end of our city is about $35 net to you if you are lucky enough to get one. Most are DT which pays $15.",2021

I got a ping at a local sushi-bar to a local dive at 2.8x and the ride was about 8 minutes. Red flags did appear early but I ignored them because the ride requestor was pretty chill. Very chill considering the company he was with, or at least he appeared to be chill at that point. Anyway, 1 minute passed, 2 minutes then 3 minutes and close to the 4 minute mark one loud mouth chick comes out thinking she is Queen of Cool and Partying. As bad as she was the girlfriend appears at 5 minutes as I was about to cancel but the boyfriend was chill and said sorry about this... ""It's her birthday...""

This is the most lily-white chick I have ever seen. Take every white chick from a John Hughes film and combined them all and you have the birthday girl. However *every* other word out of her mouth was ""*****"" and/or ""****"". In to the car she sits yelling ""It's my birthday N***as! Lets party!""

We get out of the parking lot...

Where the **** are we going?
To the bar like you said you want to go...
Uber I just ****ing want you to know it's my BIIIIIIIIRRRRRTTHHHHDAY!
I get to ****ing be obnoxious on my BIRTHHHHHHDDAYYYY!
What's your name Mr. Uber?
Fusion....
Well it's my ****ing birthday. Let's party N***as!

We are not 2 minutes in to the drive and the boyfriend says save the partying for the bar.

**** THAT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY N***a! We ****ing gotta party.
Well chill for the bar you can't party here... 
<cutting the BF off> Uber doesn't ****ing care!
Uber I can have fun at my ****ing birthday right?
We've been partying all day and we are going to the bar to party. Chill!

Now the Birthday Girl gets super quiet. YAY!

We should ****ing just go back to the hotel since you N***as don't want to party.
Why the **** are we even going to the ****ing bar. This sucks. My birthday sucks.
Don't be like it's been a great day and we can party at the bar.
**** that I don't want to go to the bar anymore.
Well we are going because you want to go!

The last two minutes everyone was quiet and she was digging for something in her purse. We arrive at the bar the boyfriend and friend get out. The birthday girl doesn't. She is ""****ing looking for that cool gift she got from Wayne/Dwayne"" or whatever name she said...

Don't forgot your phone.
I'm not stupid I ****ing know where my ****ing phone is N**ga!
Where is the ****ing gift I got? Oh here it is. Look at this Uber!

It's been almost a minute now I'm done and said ""I have another ride I need to go pick up""

**** YOU N***A I WAS JUST BEING NICE. **** YOU *****"" as she gets out and slams the passenger side rear door.

She immediately opened the door again and screamed ""**** YOU *****"" and slammed it again. I locked the doors quickly this time and drove off. I did see the boyfriend laughing so now I'm like **** that guy! I went to another parking lot to file a complaint with Uber when I get a call from Uber messing the little complaint I was writing. Then the Birthday Girl's iPhone in the back seat starting ringing!!!

I don't answer my cell but I answer her cell phone and the nicest way I could

Hellooooooo
Hi this is blah blah blah we left our phone in your car
Would that be the phone of the loud chick or the **** you ***** chick?
Yeah sorry about that can you bring the phone back?

I can hear the Birthday Girl in the back say get my ****ing phone back I need that N***a!

I hang up.

Phone rings...

Hellllllllooooooooooo!
I'm really sorry guy we just want the phone back. Bring it back.

The birthday girl is still in the background yelling ""if that ****ing Uber if he doesn't bring my phone back right now I'm ****ing calling the police and reporting it ****ing stolen.""

Dude that chick was the most disrespectful person I've come by doing rideshare. Not only did she yell **** you ***** for no reason and slam my car door she did it twice while you sat there laughing! Tell **** you ***** girl I'm tossing her phone she can come find it.

No I was not laughing come on give me a break bring the...

I hang up. The whole time we are talking I'm heading for a gas station that has a porta-potty outside. I get there and it's gone! So I went a few doors down to a McDonald's with the phone ringing until I powered it off. I put some gloves on, cut open a trash bag right at the top of the trash bin and drop the phone inside it! The trash was nasty, smelly and wet.

I got two more calls from Uber but I didn't answer as I filed the complaint with Uber and said nothing about the lost phone. I got the canned response saying they will take this situation seriously blah blah blah and so far nothing about the phone. As of right now no drop in stars...

post-6945953,Young Kim,"Mar 18, 2021 at 12:33 PM","One of my riders last night was a pickup from downtown Chicago going to a Northwest suburb last night. His name was Augustus. Nice conversation to start. I talked about sports (Cubs and Blackhawks) and then the weather. (There was rain last night in Chicago)

Then he suddenly asked me a question from out of the blue... ""What did you think about what happened during the elections?"". (My interior caution light went off of immediately). So I proceeded with caution...

I told him ""I'm not sure what happened but I know a lot of people thought there was some suspicious activity in the election"".

(Augustus): thank goodness I found someone else who agrees with me and half the country.

(Me). well I really can't comment too much because I don't know enough about the matter but what I read on various news outlets was that there was really irregular voting activity.

(Augustus). I looked out myself personally in Wisconsin and saw that there were more votes for the senators in the state than for the president. Who would go to a voting booth and not vote for the president? Also how could biden have gotten more votes than Obama? Why was there reports of hours passing in certain voting booths with 100% of the votes going for Biden and none for Trump? There was massive massive voting mail in ballot fraud.

(Me) not sure. I can see why many people would consider that.

(Augustus). You know it's really hard being a Republican in Chicago right?

(Me). Yes indeed. if you wore a red maga hat in downtown Chicago I think people would start hitting you.

(Augustus)...(he went on and on and on about how the Democratic policies were just destroying the country. He brought up how he thinks Kamala Harris is certainly going to become president if not Nancy pelosi. He told me that if Biden cannot serve 2 years then Nancy pelosi automatically according to the law becomes the president. (I'm not sure myself). He talked about how President Biden when he reads a teleprompter once he read the closed captioning brackets that introduced the next event. He said Biden was completely utterly demented, who is a puppet who is hiding in the basement. He continued saying Trump will prevail again in 2024. A lot of lies he said were spoken about the Democrats about the lethality of the virus... It went on and on and on ..and on.

(Me). (I just kept silent, trying to keep my integrity by not totally agreeing with the stuff about Trump's absolute greatness, vaccine data, masks, etc. BUT at the same time not arguing with Augustus. I stayed pleasant calm and polite throughout the entire interaction and ride. And listened with intention.)

At the end of the ride I found a $22.23 tip on my app...

post-6953857,The Gift of Fish,"Mar 21, 2021 at 5:42 AM","Uber recently lost its challenge in the UK courts to have its drivers classified as independent contractors. In a nutshell, the UK Supreme Court judged Uber's claims that it is merely a software platform that links pax and drivers to be nonsense, and that its drivers are indeed employees. Uber's reaction to making its UK drivers employees?



And:



So, in the UK, Dara and Co. accept that the UK ruling that its drivers are employees is a clearer path forward in giving its workers rights, and that it is willing to change its ways.

However, in California, the company sings along to a completely different tune. Voters decided in the Prop 22 election that Uber's drivers are not employees, but independent contractors. Uber's reaction?



And:



In California, Uber praises voters for deciding the polar opposite of the UK, and that decision to  class its drivers as employees is the best for the drivers.

Double-speak much? We, as drivers, have known for a long time that Uber has its bullshit generator running 24/7. However, up until now, the bullshit had largely been consistent. Now, Uber demonstrates that it will say whatever it thinks will benefit it the most, adapting the rhetoric at will to whatever situation it finds itself in, regardless of any contradictions with previously published positions.

Such duplicity would worry me greatly as an investor, particularly with reference to Dara's claims surrounding promised future profitability. However, with Uber's stock price still on an upward trend, none of this seems to worry the market. Go figure.

We don't need cheaper services with need higher quality services that pay 80% of the fee to the driver always. I think a minimum fee of something would work even if it was only a few blocks. It would help filter out bad customers kinda. Not always though of course.

Anyway the service is where you use the customers car to drive. Not exactly sure how it works but it seems ok. At least your not putting wear and tear on your own car. Though I see disadvantages of this for the driver somewhat. What do you all think ? Good service idea by whoever created it? It is like $22 or $23 a hour depending on where you live.

I figured out that they were around the corner and down the street. When I got there they immediately started calling me names after getting in the car. Soon, they began calling me ""gay"", ""******ed"", ""ugly ass"" and using the N word repeatedly. 

I asked them to stop swearing and to just confirm their drop off (since the pick up was incorrect) and name. They continued to call me names and swear, yelling at me. Eventually, I called Lyft's emergency ride number. The ADT rep was wonderful. After hearing a few seconds of this, including the threats to ""F up my gay ****** ass"" they recommended calling the police or immediately ending the ride. I explained that the passenger was four minutes away and there was no easy way to get them out of the car. They said they would stay with me out of a concern for my safety. 

They continued to yell similar racial and other hateful comments as I drove (""no one will ever suck your Dxxx you ugly gay ******""). I remained silent and got them to their destination. Fortunately they got out, while still threating to kill me. 

The ADT safety rep was wonderful. She was kind and recognized that I was in shock. She offered assistance and stayed with me until I could breathe again. 

Lyft? They sent me an email asking me to call them. When I did they said they were too busy and to send them an email. 

Oh, and while I was on the phone with ADT emergency support they assigned me a new pick up. I'm a 5 star drive so I pulled it together and drove there. The passenger didn't show up. After waiting ten minutes and calling and texting six times I cancelled. I received a message that ""I needed to drive close"" even though I was a foot from the front door"". I'm still trying to get my cancellation fee. Fortunately I took a phot of me right under the address and at the front door! 

Meanwhile, there is a disturbed passenger out there willing to make multiple threats to kill a Lyft driver - and Lyft could care less.

Drop him off and it starts pouring down rain like a hurricane. They already gave me a queued ride at Starbucks (so probably a short ride with someone who doesn't want to walk in the rain). I cancel it and go to sign off. Before I can do that another pops up. repeat, then again and again. Eventually I am fast enough to sign off before they can pop another ride to me.

Yeah, I'm going to work in this weather for $4 a ride when you are charging the riders 500% surge. Go get 'em yourself Lyft. I'm staying home!",2021
post-6927325,Young Kim,"Mar 12, 2021 at 11:31 AM","My first riders last night were around 7:00 p.m. it was kind of a tiger mom in an upscale neighborhood in Illinois called park ridge. The mom was with her daughter who was in high school. Definitely had to be main south high school because that's the area we were in. it's definitely full of rich people and that's where Hillary Clinton went to high school.

The daughter was explaining to the mom that there was no hybrid options anymore but it was all in person or remote only for classes. I overheard the daughter explaining to the mom that she wanted to see her friends and be in person. 

The mom was then very anxious and said ""well then I want you to double mask and wear a face shield"". And then the daughter spoke back to the mother in a very polite way and said ""Mom I will triple mask!"". 

I'm serious I almost chuckled out loud when she said that she's going to triple mask. doing one mask already for me is annoying I can't imagine if I had to wear three of them and a face shield on top of that! 

The funniest thing is the mom looked at the daughter and just nodded slowly and was grateful that the daughter was so compliant and acting proper.",2021

Picked up a girl (yes she was 18) who had Down's syndrome and drove her to her special education facility. My radio was playing Patsy Cline's ""Walking to New Orleans."" I hear a voice in the back seat singing along. The song was still playing as she got out and walked to the entrance. As she walked to the door she couldn't hear the song anymore. However it was still playing in her mind as she walked, no danced, to the door.

post-6926949,FLKeys,"Mar 12, 2021 at 8:55 AM","...as measured on Goggle Earth.

Last night I was driving down the highway at 50 MPH, 96 feet in front of me someone turns left in front of me. Luckily I had just checked my mirrors and knew the lane next to me was empty. I did not even have time to blow my horn. Slam on the brakes and swerve into the other lane just barely missing the passengers side of their car. 

96 feet sounds like a long way, when you are traveling 50 MPH it is around 1 second. Factor in 1/4 second reactionary time to realize someone pulled out in front of you and another 1/4 second reactionary time to do what your brains says to do it was way to close for me. I was inches away from hitting them.",2021
post-6915897,The Gift of Fish,"Mar 8, 2021 at 1:46 PM","This was a strange one. I got a ping to a Residence Inn for a late night 20 mile trip. I arrived at the pickup but there was no pax to pick up. Nothing unusual about that, but I then got a text from the pax, ""Skip"", asking me to call him. I don't usually phone or take calls from pax, but it was a reasonably good trip in the direction I wanted to go, so I hit the Call Passenger button in the Uber app. The phone rang out and nobody answered. Then ""Skip"" texted me that he wanted me to call him on a different number. I obviously refused. ""Skip"" then claimed that it was necessary for me to phone him in order ""to confirm"" and ""to be safe"", which makes no sense. Anyway, in the end I ""skipped"" the ride - ending this encounter with [cancel as no show / 4 bucks for me / thanks for playing / try again soon].

The last text that ""Skip"" was typing in the screenshot below was a rather desperate sounding ""Call me!!!!"". Clearly the scammer wanted to speak to me and/or to get my phone number, but I don't see why / what the scam angle would be. Maybe it's a new fishing technique to get drivers' numbers so that ""support"" can phone them later directly to pull the scam where they offer drivers a bonus in exchange for handing over their login details? The very American name of ""Skip"" combined with the very poor English makes me think foreign scammer.

Anyone know what this is about or come across it before?

post-6817749,JohnJames8678,"Jan 31, 2021 at 3:54 AM","Ok, so if you are creepy or look like Shrek mixed with Seth Rogen this probably won’t work, but when I used to drive Lyft back in my early 20’s I had luck with this little trick. I would whip out bumble or tender whenever someone hot pinged me. I’d get the date app pulled up and start swiping as the passenger was walking up. They’d get in and see i would have bumble and then mention something like “omg your on bumble too” and BAM you’ve got them thinking about dating and the conversation started. I’d follow it up with something like “I’m new at this, I just downloaded the app and thought I’d give it a try, I’m not too sure how it works”. This was like chum in the water. Play innocent, she might ask to switch upfront and wanna look at your phone to see your profile and your face up close. Keep some fire matches in your bumble deck so when she looks at your phone she notices you’ve got hot woman you’ve already matched with, this will bring out her competitive spirit and make her just a bit insecure and jealous. Trust me you’ll actually appear more attractive #ProTip. Also, Have a GOOD profile picture. Men I cannot emphasize this enough. Be sure you have a nice headshot, no double chin taken from the front seat of your car. Get in good lighting, put a nice shirt on, wash your face and comb your hair and use your portrait mode selfie in good lighting then upload it to Lyft. Accentuate that jaw! Ok, now back to my advice. She’s chatting with you now! This will lead into 1 of 2 avenues. 1 she’s taken or uninterested, in that case she will usually give you tips on your profile and you can max out your bumble game or 2 she’s single and y’all hit it off and you get her number. Just a little tip that seemed to work.",2021

post-6912351,Young Kim,"Mar 7, 2021 at 6:54 AM","I picked up a pax in Chicago, and as we talked, he said to me, ""You seem like a very knowledgeable guy, could you please give me advice on what to do with my girlfriend?"" ""We are having issues."" His real name I remember was Lorenzo. (I don't see an issue with saying his real name because he did not disclose anything illicit or extremely personal...it is just sort of an innocent story). I replied, ""OK, I'll try to do my best."" He said, ""Well, my girlfriend said we should try to stop something we are doing... and be more responsible"". (I wondered if it was something bad like drugs or gambling or overspending). 

He went on to say that his girlfriend is starting to feel guilty about how they are sexually active. Lorenzo said that he wanted to get married to her soon, and she expressed that she felt the same about him. The issue was that she felt if they are planning to get married, she should not be sexually active prior to marriage. She said that there was a thing about ""re-virginizing oneself"". He said he was frustrated that he would have to wait for sexual fulfillment. He said he was 32 years old, and his girlfriend was 28. 

At least to me, he was very gentle, sort of shy, and the sort of person that could not hurt a fly. I remarked to him about this, how gentle and kind he seemed, and he said that has always been his personality. I asked him about his girlfriend (advising him not to get too personal) and he said his girlfriend was the same. I then asked if religion had anything to do with his girlfriend wanting to ""re-virginize"" herself (I pondered if she was Muslim, where pre-marital sex is particularly frowned upon. 

He told him that both he and his girlfriend were Christian. I then asked him, ""Do you want to marry her then? Do you see a forever long term relationship with her?"" Without hesitation, he said that he does, and that there is no other for him. So then I advised him, ""Well, then bro, the answer is obvious... get married right away, don't wait. If you know she is ""the one"", and she is going to withhold sex from you now, then just get married immediately"".

He replied that the issue was his family was very very large, and that both of them talked about it and how having a wedding during this pandemic would be exceedingly difficult. So they felt they needed to wait...

I then suggested a solution that he got really happy to hear... I told him that a few of my younger cousins secretly got married this year, just in court, without telling anyone in the family. They did so for many reasons, and they did not want to say just invite a few people in the family and have others feel left out. But, they immediately told everyone in the family through a group e-mail that they plan to have the BIG family wedding AFTER the pandemic restrictions lift and then everyone will feel included.

This solution seemed to surprise Lorenzo, and he said, ""Omg, why didn't I think of that before?!"" He thanked me profusely, and seemed incredibly happy. Then he said that he would propose the idea to his girlfriend right away. After he left, I could tell that at least he was sincere because he left a $5 tip on a rather short ride. Sometimes, we ants have to play therapist. In this case, I found a solution that the pax really appreciated. 

Question for my fellow ants...have you also had a situation where you found a keen solution to a relationship issue that the pax latched onto?

(The next day I asked some female friends that I have if ""re-virginizing"" is a thing before marriage....and I found that many of them agreed with Lorenzo's girlfriend.... that many women do this to buttress their feelings of innocence and integrity as a lady. I suppose that I learn every day. I heard of this, but I really did not know how prevalent such a thing really was.)",2021
post-6912401,Young Kim,"Mar 7, 2021 at 7:45 AM","This was a first...not just one, but two of my pax fell flat onto the pavement as they exited my Uber. I picked up around 3:00 am three pax at a bar called ""Drink"" in Schaumburg, IL as the bar was closing. All three got into my car just fine, so I accepted them into my car. I of course would have thought of cancelling if they stumbled towards my car, but all three walked just fine.

But after they got into the car, I knew at least two were completely smash drunk. The girlfriend of one of the pax slumped over onto her boyfriend's shoulder almost immediately and passed out. Jose, the pax who ordered was sitting behind me slurring his speech profoundly. The boyfriend of the girl seemed OK, and spoke to me and Jose. As we drove, the boyfriend spoke to Jose and they discussed how awesome the night was, and Jose remarked about how utterly completely smash drunk he was, and how he vomited in the bathroom many times.

I could tell this was the case, as there was a stench of vomit as he spoke. (I think other ants could attest to this, you know the smell...) The boyfriend then told me that they do this a lot, go out and get completely smash drunk. Jose then told me and the boyfriend (of the girl who has passed out) how much he enjoyed the night.

I wondered about this, why people do this? I got drunk once..........but just . The experience was so physically uncomfortable and I hated the feeling of a loss of control. It would be like if I was driving a car, and the steering wheel got a ton of ""play"" in it, and the brakes were sluggish, and the accelerator did not respond, etc. Can anyone comment as to why people do this? I can not fathom how someone would regularly subject themselves to experiencing profound bodily sickness and a psychological loss of control.

Anyhow, when we got to the destination, all three got out, but the girlfriend was so disoriented. Suddenly, as she was walking, she collapsed onto the pavement...hard. I was shocked and got out, and I saw that Jose and the boyfriend lifted her and she seemed OK and smiled in an embarrassed way at me. I asked if she was OK, and all three assured me that she was. The two guys put her arms on their shoulder, and walked a few steps towards their apartment complex. But.....suddenly both Jose AND the girlfriend collapsed onto the pavement. (Not slowly falling down, and putting their outstretched hands down)...but just fell flat very fast and hard! I was alarmed and asked the boyfriend if they needed an ambulance. But he said no. I cautiously watched them to observe them for a few minutes. They got up and all three went in shoulder to shoulder and sort of did a dance swaying side to side moving as one body....until they disappeared right in the hallway.

I am writing about this because I have documented before on UP.net some very alarming instances of brutal intoxication. Can anyone hazard a guess as to why some pax do this on a routine basis? It appears to me some type of mental issue or masochism. Maybe once I can understand (never to be repeated), but to get smash drunk many times a month year after year and be pleased with the experience?

At least they were taking an Uber home....",2021
post-6916917,Young Kim,"Mar 8, 2021 at 6:28 PM","First trip last night in Chicago was some guy named Brian who told me that he had just finished a marathon run on playing Magic the Gathering with many friends...12 hours of it! He and his friends were overjoyed because they were all celebrating as a result of the massive stimulus being passed. He was a laid off worker from an advertising company in Chicago named Leo Burnett. 

We talked about his group of friends who he was playing the games with, and one of them was a laid off airline engine mechanic at O'Hare airport. I can't now remember the airline. Anyway he said that his friend was asked back by the airline to start work again. He told me his friend refused, because of the extended unemployment until September. his friend said that even though there's little chance of getting covid at his job because he is an airline mechanic, he is entitled to a very long paid vacation after putting in so much time with the airline. His other friends also felt the same way. I browse through other websites on my downtime. Majority of laid off workers with the extended unemployment/ PUA all feel that they deserve this gravy train. 

I hope that finally when they have to go back to work they're prepared to do so and keep their job skills up-to-date. as for the airline mechanic I'm afraid that his job might not be waiting for him when he's finally ready to return. his job is not like driving for Uber where you can just log on and start taking rides.",2021
post-6912419,Young Kim,"Mar 7, 2021 at 8:02 AM","Weekends are when I get my best stories, and I thought this one was interesting. I picked up a pax named William near the Merchandise Mart train station in downtown Chicago, and we got to discussing the pandemic and how he was dealing with it. He shared with me that just over a year ago, he was let go from the most fun job he ever had. He was working for Yelp! (the company who does the online reviews for restaurants and local businesses). He said that it was by far the most fun he ever had, and he was making great money.

William said that the top salesman for the downtown Chicago office made over $30,000 in commission in a month! before the pandemic crushed business. He said he was one of the top salesman and made six figures. And......he loved the environment. He told me about how there was pre-pandemic nearly 1000 people in the Yelp! downtown office, and after you go through security, it was a job workplace heaven. He gave the funny analogy that the ""pit"" where everyone was selling was like in the movie ""Wolf of Wall Street"", and how when someone got a big sale, everyone would know because some ""horn"" would go off and everyone would go over and congratulate the salesman. (He mentioned though there was no drugs or dwarfs thrown).

The pax told me that there were ping pong tables, other amenities like board games and lounge chairs (to be used during break), and FREE BEER and FREE FOOD! And he said it was very good food, all you can eat. I was surprised because I thought that only like Amazon, Facebook, and Google had this type of workplace amenities. I didn't know Yelp! had that kind of money.

William told me that the company really cared about making employees happy. He said that as the pandemic crushed business, Yelp! tried hard to keep as many people onboard and on payroll. He said that he started working remotely from home, but it was totally soul crushing. After all, restaurants and businesses closed down, and trying to get new clients was darn near impossible, he said.

He said Yelp! paid some bonuses and tried and tried,...but in the end, it was not enough, and he and most everyone was let go. He said there is still a shell left of his team in the downtown Chicago office, and he has no ill will towards his former company because they tried so hard to survive, but the Chicago location collapsed anyhow. After a few months on UI, he found a job with FedEx as a driver, and he was being dropped off in the Niles, IL location (by Touhy ave and Niles Center road). He seemed happy enough as a FedEx employee, and we both discussed that business was BOOMING for FedEx and his job is likely secure as an ironclad chain.

But wistfully, he lamented the loss of the best job he said he ever had in his life....",2021
post-6912647,ANT 7,"Mar 7, 2021 at 10:20 AM","This is from the.........""I wouldn't believe it unless I saw it myself""..........files.

Yesterday at about 1145 AM I was stuck at a red light in heavy traffic in front of a McDonald's drive thru. Apparently, two vehicles had tried to enter the single D/T lane at the same time, a white van (who was in the right, appeared to have been first, and had the legal ROW regardless) and a red Ford Taurus that was trying to butt in front of him by entering from the busy avenue I was stuck on (which is illegal to stand/stop on when trying to enter the D/T lanes of this McD).

Dude in the van is calmly talking out his window to the Taurus pax, when the driver of the Taurus exits his vehicle and walks over to the van and proceeds to start punching the van driver. So, the van driver backs up, parks, and exits his vehicle with his cell phone held in a position that made it obvious he was filming. Taurus driver grabs the cell and throws it Tom Brady style across all four lanes of traffic, where it bounces against the side of the wall of a Money Mart, and lands on the sidewalk. Yes, it was that kind of neighbourhood.

Van driver runs across the traffic, grabs his phone, turns and runs back across the traffic, but doesn't stop. He picks up speed and when he is about 5 feet from the Taurus driver, he jumps in the air Bruce Lee style and lands a left food directly on the Taurus driver's jaw sending him to the ground like a wet towel. An EPIC take down to say the least.

Taurus drivers G/F gets out of the car yelling ""OMG you've killed Johnny""........he's not dead BTW, he's just lying flat on the parking lot like J/C about to get nailed to the cross. Van driver gets back in his van and drives away. The red light changes color, and I do the same.

post-6895013,Young Kim,"Mar 1, 2021 at 2:42 AM","On Saturday night at 3:30 am, I had a pickup in Skokie, IL (a north suburb) by AMC Theaters also near Red Robin and Buffalo Wild Wings. I swiped right, and saw the three young men entering my Uber were going to the Hyatt Place in Rosemont, IL, about a 13 minute ride. Immediately I noticed they were drunk, but even more vexing...very loud. They began to ask me many questions, about everything. I answered abruptly with monosyllables. They were loud... ugh. Then, one of them got on their phone and put it on speaker and called some girl. Then they all proceeded to have a group discussion of their night, also asking me questions to try to involve me in their drunken talk. 

It was the end of a long Saturday night, which are always very taxing for an Uber ant. Especially now during the pandemic, it has gotten so very much worse. So I was not in a mood to feign interest with 3 very loud annoying pax who was discussing their hard partying with some girl they all knew. I could hear them talk stuff like, ""Yeah, when we sat down on the table and that other group approached I was pissed..."", ""Don't you think that the promoter will be interested in holding that party for next weekend?""...stuff like that.

So, I put on my Sony ""almost"" noise cancelling headphones (with very snug earbuds), and turned on some peaceful classical music at a loud volume. I told them that I need to listen to the Uber navigation system to insure that I drive to their destination properly, so I may not be able to communicate with them. Suddenly, as the soft notes of the symphony emerged, the three annoying pax almost seemed to magically disappear from my car. I could hear them still trying to talk to me, gesturing at me, and one even tapped my shoulder trying to get my attention.

I did remove one earbud and asked, ""Is there a problem?"", and he answered, ""No, I just wanna ask you how...(this and that)"". I interrupted with, ""So sorry, but I need to hear the Uber navigation. It is very important."" And then put back on my classical music... 

Soooo nice. It was suddenly like I was in another world of peace and harmony.

I think they got the message, because at the end of the ride, they just got out without saying a word, and I did not say ""goodnight"" either. I recommend everyone get a pair of very snug blutooth headphones (preferably noise cancelling), which will drown out annoying pax. I am doing this more and more now, with great results.

The only issue of course is that you won't be able to hear other traffic, like someone honking their horn. And most importantly, you must redouble your sight for any emergency vehicles since you won't be able to hear sirens. But....I think that at least for me, it is totally worth it. When an annoying pax is about to test my patience, some Mozart, Beethoven, or Handel will help me immensely.

For myself, I care nothing at all about getting a one star review from the pax if they feel I am ignoring them. If they are loud and obnoxious, I put them on ignore... with great satisfaction and relief.",2021

Also, I very regrettably sent a bunny into rabbit heaven. It was strange because I do sometimes have to narrowly avoid clueless pedestrians, but this all happened within a short span of time in one night. The first was the most jarring, because I nearly (without exaggeration) came very close to striking a pax darting out from between two cars into another Uber.

I was driving southbound on Linder Ave approaching Lawrence Ave in the north side of Chicago, and on a narrow street, when a would be pax literally jumped out from between two cars and ran in front of my car to their Uber across the street. I hit the brake and gasped at how close I came to hitting him/her. After stopping, I saw the other Uber ant's face who was parked look at me ...and we both shook our heads in disbelief. His pax, in a white parka jacket, with fur on the hoodie so I could not see the face, jumped into the Uber, completely not even acknowledging that he/she (I could not tell) almost got seriously injured. The street was 30 mph, so if I did not brake hard, I doubt the pax would have had life threatening injuries, but he/she would have been gravely hurt.

How many of you have had a person sprint in front of your vehicle running for their own Uber?

Next I was driving west on Harrison Street by Halsted next to the UIC campusk a short while later, and I saw a bunny suddenly jump into the street in a hurry. I slammed on the brakes (I was doing an UberEats order so there was no pax in my car), and veered right fast. As the car decelerated quickly, I thought I cleared the bunny easily......but...it jumped back right into my path under my tires in the last split second!

Squirrels (very common) I have avoided easily because they move in a predictable trajectory, and at constant velocity and zero acceleration. Deer are easy to avoid because they are large and move slowly. Geese or birds are even easier because they move either very very slowly or just fly away. But this bunny was moving and darting all over the place! As it jumped into my path, it hopped like up, left, down, and then finally back to my right...just as I thought I missed it. I heard a thud... I felt awful and disgusted, then hoped that it was not the bunny.

I slowly backed up away left from center...but I saw the heap of rabbit lying in the road. I am not sure why that bothered me so much, but I felt really awful. But not guilty. Because I knew that I did everything I could to avoid that bunny. Plus I was as I always am paying close attention to animals. And I was not speeding at all. It was the very first time in my life I hit a bunny, and noted that I could not have predicted its movement, as it seemed in retrospect completely random and unpredictable. Its last jump was right into my tire paths...sigh.

And so surprisingly (because it happened again shortly later), my next pax pickup was further south in the south side of Chicago by Roosevelt Ave and Racine Ave (a rather faster moving bigger street, 35 mph) I saw a man just run across the street in front of my car. However, I saw him running from the sidewalk easily, as his path was not obscured by cars like the first pedestrian I mentioned who appeared suddenly in between two parked cars. I ended up braking hard though, and he slowly just walked in front of my car as I came to a complete stop. I was a bit unhappy that some people just run into the street (even on a busy street) without looking at ALL. 

I am certain that all Uber ants have come close to hitting clueless pedestrians and likely causing roadkill of animals through no fault of their own. But have any of you actually HIT a pedestrian? Please do share your story of near misses...",2021

While the guy checks the rooms the clerk takes the bill and runs across the street and pays his $100 bill at the food store for the hotel food. The store manager takes the $100 and runs to the hooker he owed for sex. The hooker runs back to the hotel and pays the clerk the $100 she owed for the room.

post-6879123,Young Kim,"Feb 23, 2021 at 5:09 AM","OK, just when I thought this job cannot get any worse... it did, tonight, a couple of hours ago. I would like to ask at the end if anyone has had a most frustrating pax than the one I just had. The pax was a long pickup in Des Plaines, IL. The name on the app was Jordan. (this is in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, IL, in a middle class suburb). Pax came out of a nice apartment complex. The pax comes out, and everything starts off OK. But then he asks me, ""Do you have an aux cord?"" (Warning to newbies, never ever offer an aux cord if asked, pax will demand you play their music at full blast on repeat the entire ride). I said no of course. Then he asks if he can Blutooth his phone to my car speaker system. I replied of course, ""No, sir, my blutooth system does not work.""

Jordan tells me that he wishes to have me listen to his and his friend, ""Kuta Magnificent""'s recent hip hop song (which he argued would be the single top most downloaded song on Spotify, predicting at least a BILLION downloads... I said, ""so sorry Jordan, but my blutooth system does not work, but if you tell me the song, I'll look it up after I get home tonight, OK?"" Jordan just gets his phone out and starts playing his and his friend's song....... , but the song title was ... (that's right, that  was the name of the song)

I could not believe the garbage that came out of his phone... Mind you, I enjoy all music, including hip-hop and rap music. But his song, ""In the Shit"", was 5 minutes of a guy singing, ""He is in the shit."", ""Bweetch (you all know the actual word) is in the shit"", ""My boy is in the shit"", ""(the N-word) is in the shit"", ""My homie is in the shit"" interspersed with all manner of profanity and vulgar language describing criminal behavior (like shooting drugs, defaming women, committing crimes, etc). I heard the song 4 times in the 20 minute ride... I had to bear hearing some guy rapping the words, "" probably more than two hundred times. I tried to be polite... but I could feel my remaining feelings of positivity towards pax being wiped away, like a vestigial organ or decaying body part.

He asked me to be friends on Facebook and Instagram over and over. I replied, ""Sorry, Uber community guidelines prohibit such communication"". Then at the end of the ride, he asked me AGAIN if I could look him up on Instagram and download and listen AGAIN to his fabulous song, ""In the Shit"", and tell all my friends about it. He said he and his friend, ""Kuta Magnificent"" would become big, as big as Drake, Lil' Wayne, Jay-Z, and The Weeknd. Now, I really enjoy much of the work of the previous artists... But his song, ""In the Shit""... was literally the worst piece of hip-hop I have ever heard.

I already had a stacked order right behind this ride, and so I told Jordan that I cannot stop and look up and download his song, ""In the Shit"". I showed him on my app the green dot after his ride proving that I indeed had another rider who had been waiting a very long time. I told him that the next rider is already waiting 20 minutes, and therefore I could not take any more time since the ride was over. At the end of the ride when we reached the destination, I swiped right and asked very politely if he would exit the vehicle since the next rider had been waiting.

Then he got upset and really bizarre...

Jordan said his real name was ""Kuta Amazing"", not ""Jordan"" (so I really don't know his real name now). He kept insisting...then ... that I look up and download his song, and spread the ""incredible"" work of art of his and his friend's to my friends and my social media connections. When I said I cannot right then but I will do so after my shift was over, he started calling me a ""dumb Asian boy"" over and over...like 20 times! He said I was missing out on letting others know how great his song, ""In the Shit"" was.

I steadfastly insisted that he exit my vehicle, he just refused over and over...and just sat there. He argued that the next passenger does not have a song as great as his, so I would be justified in making the next passenger wait. I replied that it is unlikely that the next pax is even a hip-hop singer. Also, I tried to explain to him that it was very inconsiderate to make someone wait for such an endeavor.

Then he got quiet... and I started to feel a bit nervous. Maybe 45 seconds passed of silence, and I contemplated calling for help (through the Uber app or 911). But this was a moment to try to prevent any escalation. I was in a safe middle class neighborhood in Illinois after all. And he was not being immediately threatening... Rather, he was simply refusing to exit the vehicle and seemed insulted that I would not download his song then and there.

I tried to say encouraging things, positive things, to make him feel better and have him exit the vehicle. Finally, a car approached from behind us, and I told him that I must insist that he exit the vehicle immediately. As I drove forward to allow the car behind me to pass, he  opened the car door put his feet out as his legs dragged across the cement and yelled, ""Bweetch, why are you moving the f'ing car?!""... (I immediately thought to myself, ""WHY ARE YOU OPENING THE CAR DOOR AND TRYING TO STEP OUT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING??!) I was stunned...he could have seriously injured himself.

I stopped fast to avoid him being dragged under my wheels. When the car stopped he finally got out... Never was I more happy that a ride had ended. Strangely, he waved bye to me and smiled!

Since the pandemic began, this job has gotten more and more challenging as the months have passed (I have driven without interruption all months of the past year). To those of you sitting this out during the pandemic, it is likely a very wise decision. I think my sanity is slowly withering away. I think I may start posting like  or maybe far far worse soon if this constant march of negativity does not destroy the final fragments of love and faith I have left for humanity... As I drove off, I literally thought I was dreaming...having a terrible nightmare. Like I really could not believe I had such a crazy passenger... I reflect now that maybe he was high on Crystal Meth or Crack Cocaine...

(Below I will upload a one minute video YouTube link of ""Jordan"" or maybe his name is actually ""Kuta Amazing"" at the end of the ride as he refused to exit my vehicle. You can hear at least one instance of him calling me ... he called me that at least 20 times at the end of the trip, just because I refused to sit and download onto my phone his magnum opus, ""In the Shit"". I can see that upon listening to the audio that I am talking rather fast, normally I do not. But I was very agitated on trying to have him exit my vehicle ASAP. Also, I did not take video footage of his face...)


At this point I am sure everyone knows that I really try my best to be as patient, compassionate, and caring as a person should while driving Uber. But after this ride...... I can see how people can lose their sanity. I am hoping  does not have to read a post of mine in the future where I demonstrate an unbridled hatred of humans. I cannot allow myself to go there.

Finally, I wish to state unequivocally that I was NOT exaggerating the utter sheer insanity of this pax and the aspects of this ride...this all really happened! Before anyone questions why I did not yell and scream at the passenger to ""Get the F out of my car!"", you had to see him and how bizarre he was acting at the end. I thought it best to not agitate him.",2021
post-6896347,FLKeys,"Mar 1, 2021 at 3:42 PM","I got a call from Uber Support that one of my previous PAX said he left his wallet in my car and asked me to call the PAX or text support back.

I checked my car no wallet. Texted support back saying no wallet in my car, sorry. Well Uber support was nice enough to give the PAX my phone number. Get a call and it says SPAM Risk, okay I love messing with these people, I answer. It is my PAX that says her husband left a wallet. I tell her I replied to Uber they should have forwarded the reply to her. She said they did but she knows the wallet is in my car and she wants it back.

With that attitude I said I checked, its not here, sorry. Good Bye and hung up. She tried calling me back 4 more times. I get a call from another number, I don't answer. They leave a message. It is the husband, he tells me he knows the wallet was in his right hand when he got in my car (he got in the driver side rear door) and he put the wallet in the middle of the seat to answer his phone and forgot to grab the wallet when he got out.

I text back that there was no wallet in my car or if he did leave it one of my next PAX must have seen and took it. 

20 minutes later I get a 1 ⭐ rating pop up. Oh well, don't really care about the rating. This morning I realize his story was detailed enough that it should show in my dash cam. You can clearly see him walking up to my car with empty hands. You can see him get in the car and his right hand is clearly empty. You can see him answer his phone and never have a wallet or put it down.

post-6874171,Young Kim,"Feb 21, 2021 at 6:01 AM","All these long hours trying in vain to keep positive are weighing me down... and I can sense darker feelings coming over me. Around 2:00 am, I had a pickup at a bar in the northwest suburbs of Chicago in Arlington Heights. After the pax made me wait (I remember her name was Patricia) for 3 minutes, I saw her come out in a group of 4. I rolled down my window and said, ""Sorry, but there is too many people"". 

She was clearly drunk, and her face was red. She just stared with glassy eyes for a short while silently, and then said, ""Well, can you still take me and my friends home?"" 

I said, ""Sorry, too many people"". (I have a cooler and a bunch of stuff in my front passenger seat)

She replied, ""Can't you move the stuff to the trunk?"" ""I'll tip you"".

I replied to her that I could even though it is against Uber policy... but it may be easier for her to order a second Uber...

At this point, she acted all entitled... and she said angrily, ""What is wrong with you?!"" ""Are you OK?"" ""Are you OK to take us home??!""

I felt something in me snap... (I thought to myself ""obviously why the heck would I not be OK? it is you that is not OK because you are an angry drunk!"")

I abruptly said to her, :""Hey! I'm cancelling this ride! I did nothing wrong here, and suddenly you are being rude to me. I don't take rude customers"". She just stared at me in shock and disbelief... but then I think it dawned on her that she made a mistake. 

I felt such a joy cancelling on her. She did not think this through. Tonight, the wait times, especially in the suburbs, were LONG. Like 15-20 minutes long. And...people were telling me that Ubers were cancelling on them. And the bar she was at with her friends was closing. And, some pax were telling me that they saw the dreaded, ""Sorry no UberX's in your area, pls try again later"" in the northwest suburbs where I was driving. She may have to wait for 15-20 minutes (or longer), and would have to beg the bar to let her and her friends stay inside until another Uber shows up.

Drunk entitled pax often act in a manner that is completely illogical and detrimental. She probably thought in her drunken state that she could be rude and order the Uber drivers to do whatever she wanted. 

Big mistake... this was not pre-Covd in the middle of downtown Chicago. Her friends who were sober knew instantly the mistake Patricia made, and apologized and asked if I would bring them anyway. 

I said, ""No."" I knew also that once the ride started, she would complain and give me crap the entire ride, and obviously one star me (which I don't care about), but I didn't want to deal with an angry drunk pax INSIDE my car. I found that if the pax before the ride even starts, sniffs of a problem, it is better to cut your losses... and get out of there.",2021

post-6874185,Young Kim,"Feb 21, 2021 at 6:22 AM","This was an interesting ride in the sense that it echoes more or more of what I am experiencing with pax. I picked up a couple of young men in the southwest suburbs of Chicago (Western Springs), and brought them all the way up to the north side of Chicago. In this long ride, I had a lot of time to talk to them. Both were out of school now and wanted to become YouTube, TikTok, Instagram stars. They wanted to make it as recording artists...across social media. They told me that they do livestream feeds where people tune into their work, and as I understood it they mix music, like hip-hop.

Where it became more interesting to me was that they gave up looking for a stable job because the price of Bitcoin was soaring so much, that they felt they will never have to work a real job again for the rest of their lives. I did check after the ride ended, and I just saw it hit around $57,000 per Bitcoin. I feel like the pandemic low last year was around $5,000. They kept telling me that I should invest heavily in it... they spoke of it almost as if it was a new religion. They were talking one million dollars per Bitcoin...and stuff like that.

I heard that Uber may accept Bitcoin as payment...or some rumors of that?

I wished them well, and for their sake I hope that they achieve their dreams. But I wondered to myself if this is the right attitude? Can a plethora of young college age/college graduates decide and become successful cryptocurrency investors... and not have to work any real jobs? 

I am not sure if such an attitude is best. I do own some Bitcoin actually, and I don't recommend it or not recommend it here...but I wanted to share an interesting story about how many young people are banking on the price of it to allow them never to do 9-5 again.

We hit it off at the start of the 30 minute ride, and it turns out she was in charge of take out and deliveries at this large place on the VD weekend. Decided to interview her on the sly for some UP content........heh.

They turned off all internet delivery apps after the first 2 hours (around 600 PM) because they were getting slammed on all fronts (DD, UE, and STD) and could not handle it. Mainy the apps though were causing the trouble. Too many people ordering and no kitchen can keep up, too many customers complaining, losing 30% in fees and having things sit an hour plus for pickups was the reason. As these are the least profitable orders by far, they got whacked.

Next was pick ups for take out from their own website, which were averaging about 3-5 orders every 15 minutes for about 3 hours straight. They track this metric in 15 minute segments apparently, and promote it with discounts and a points program for members.

They also had a 90 minute line to be seated until close, as they were not doing reservations. Covid here means you can only seat 50% capacity, so, they were being ruthless and doing first come first serve with a 90 min max seating time. Can't say I blame them.",2021

The guy suddenly started asking me if I was Korean. I replied, ""Yes, sir, I am"". He proceeded to ask me 27 times exactly if I was Korean on a 17 minute ride. Each time, I would answer ""Yes."" After around the 20th time, I started counting it back to him. ""Yes, I am Korean, that is for the 22nd time""...""Yes, I am Korean, for the 23rd time""...""Yes, I am Korean, for the 24th time"" etc. At this point, I went from being annoyed to very amused...

The girlfriend (who was very cute), started to apologize profusely and kept telling her boyfriend to shut up. She was quite friendly and tried to divert the repeated questions to other topics. She asked me if I thought she was fit and cute, showed me her stomach, to which I replied, ""Of course!...""haven't you seen a mirror recently?""

Then... the boyfriend suddenly started asking me, "" ...are you Korean?"" over and over...

I calmly replied that both my parents are Korean, so my genetics followed from that biological fact... He in his drunken state, started to repeat that same question over and over... afraid to get to the 27th time for that question, I cut him off... I then answered by having a short talk about how there are 46 chromosomes in each cell of my body... consisting of 22 pairs, and two sex chromosomes...inheritance patterns, etc. And all this explains why my being Korean has a logical connection to my parents being Korean.

For my own amusement, I quickly pointed out how traits are inherited from each parent through DNA transmission according to Mendelian genetics... and again tried to explain that is the reason I am in fact Korean and not another race...

After a long silent pause... he again asked...""So...why are you Korean?""

I tried so hard not to laugh...

But there is one variety of pax who I appreciate more than most...its the pax who unknowingly ""aids and abets"" me to weed out their low paying/potentially problematic rides by ""outing"" themselves with messages which reveal the ""true colors"" of what might transpire if I dare PU at their ""pin drop"".

Upon receipt of such messages I quickly cancel, then re-cast my net for higher paying rides/lower drama rides, saving me the hassle of having to haul it 5 mins down the road, only to see a nonsensical ride that I can't work with.

This is a thank you to them, because they keep my economic fly wheel turning, without having to break my vibe or mess up my bottom line.

The pax who sends these revealing message is indeed a special one...because unlike their stealthier counterparts (who KNOW what they/their rides are so mask their true location and/or identity or continually launch new accounts, to woo drivers back into their den), they volunteerily ""tip their hand"" to show me the kinda of ride most likely to suck time, money and energy out of my hustle, possibility ending my hustle on a sour note.

These message are super helpful in my market where U/L don't show pax destination (until you accept all the +25 min away rides and ""score"" a 95% AR or something like, which I DONT have)....one can sniff out rides which don't make financial sense by simply reading and understanding these pax messages.

Here are a few of my ""choice"" favorites, with interpretations:

Pax message: ""We are at the Circle K"" [and its 1am... just scored and need a mule, bruh!]

Pax message: ""I have a lot of groceries"" [so can you load our 2 carts full, drive .75 miles, park your nice new car in section 8 housing after dark and leave it unattended to run my stuff up 4 flights of stairs for $2.25 and..ooh, don't worry because I'll take care of you on the app]

The best one is...

Pax message: ""You are picking my son up from middle school school"" [thus violating your ToS on a ride which is not only awkward but not completely legal, and can result in legal action].

By the way...this message is a good one to screen shot, and then dash to U/L, inviting them to discuss ToS with pax.

Are there any pax messages you all get which prompt a quick cancellation?",2021

post-6843529,FLKeys,"Feb 10, 2021 at 9:04 AM","Yes, Juan in your red Toyota Sienna, I would like to thank you for demanding a $35.00 upfront cash tip from your passenger last night around 6:00 PM. 

Okay I know chances are real slim that Juan will ever read this.

Yesterday around 6:00 PM I get a ping for a trip 35 miles south, estimated to be 45 minutes long. I pull up and there are 3 ladies, mom and and two teens estimated in the 16-17 year old range. I verify identity and they all pile in the back seat. I know this trip is going to an area that is farther away from my house and chances of getting a ride back to my area will be slim but oh well.

Mom immediately gets on the phone and says we are in a second Uber and should be there in less than an hour. My mind starts to wonder??? Several minutes later Mom gets on the phone again, and I hear here say ride issue, okay she is on the phone with Uber support. After some frustration she gets connected to a person.

Basically, Juan in a red Toyota Sienna came to pick them up. After they were in the car he started the trip and saw where they are going. Guessing Juan does not have Uber Pro Status. She said Juan proceeded to demand a $35 cash tip up front because he would have to drive back 35 miles with no pay. She refused, Juan kicked them out and drove off.

She was going off on the Uber rep on the phone, she also had to repeat twice to the rep ""No not Paul I am in his car now and we are heading to our hotel"", it was Juan that was the problem.

Juan demanded $35.00, kicked out his PAX and his PAX rewarded me with a nice crisp $50.00 bill upon arrival to their resort. She thanked me for a nice safe professional ride.

On a side note I did several trips in that area while I was there and also my final trip in that area took me 14 miles back toward my house. Well worth the slight inconvenience of going 35 miles away from home.",2021

Uber has seen fit to remove the ""request cleaning fee"" help function from the Help section in its app, so I phoned the critical support number. Rohit said to send in photos and he would process the fee. A short time later, I got a message from him that he had assessed the fee and charged the pax $40 for puking on my car. It appears that the days of the insta-$200 puke fee are long gone. I told Rohit that $40 wasn't enough. He wrote back confirming that it was, and I wrote back confirming that it wasn't. It definitely isn't.




Anyway, Rohit said that the $40 would be credited to my account by the next pay statement, which ended last night. It wasn't. After further pressing, Rohit said that it would be paid out ""in the next few business days"". I replied that that was not good enough, and that since he had already charged the customer, I wanted payment now; there is no reason to delay payment. It looks like my emails are now being diverted into Uber's Bottomless Pit of No Reply email folder, though, as Rohit has stopped responding.

A pickup truck passed me at high speed on the right, which kicked up a rock, and then, CRACK !!! Took me 15 seconds to realize it was this window which was taken out, because, 99.5% of them seem to hit your windshield, and nothing more......right ? Kept staring at my windscreen looking for the damage, but saw nothing corresponding to the sound of the impact, until I checked my mirrors and saw this.

Dealer list price, because no used parts were available anywhere, was $299 CAD plus taxes.....they cut me 15% off, so I paid $260 CAD plus tax. FWIW an entire new front aftermarket windshield is a mere $275 CAD plus tax installed. Go figure.......heh.

It's only like a half an hour of tech time though to replace it. Pop of the inner plastic window trim, undo two small bolts, pop the entire assembly out (it comes as the glass, and frame, with mouldings attached) put the new part in, then reassemble it.

I just wanted to share a bit of success I have had and perhaps inspire someone who has been on the fence about taking the leap. In september I officially did my last Uber ride and although it had many ups downs I’m thankful for Uber because at a time of need when I need some extra income I was able to just do that. Uber is a terrible company to work for and after a while it does wear on you and I truly lasted as long as I could, after working a regular 9-5 I would put in 15 to 30 hours a week on Uber and did this for almost 2 years. September of 2020, I finally had enough I was working 7 days a week some days 14 hours a day between both jobs and I just needed a break.
In December i decided to give the stock market I try, my first month was a complete bust I lost about $1200 of my original $5,000 investment and completely took out all my investments. However after doing a lot more research and some studying and following the market I decided to give it another run. Since January 1st I have more than tripled my portfolio with a lot of success, some failure a lot of learning and much more learning left to do. This is definitely not for everyone but if you have an analytical brain and some good sense there is money to be made in the market. No I don’t have a channel, I don’t post what I buy or am I trying to get people to subscribe to anything. However if you have any inclination do your research and maybe start with a paper account, there is money to be made.",2021
post-6829725,The Gift of Fish,"Feb 4, 2021 at 10:14 PM","I see many cars with no disabled placard hanging from the rear view mirror or disabled licence plate parked in spaces for the disabled. It's usually a ghetto-special car, decked out with such crappery as ugly aftermarket rims, too-dark window tints etc, and the ghetto trash driving it is too lazy to walk an extra few paces.

On the other hand, in over-the-top California at least, businesses often have at least five times as many spaces for the disabled as are needed. These spaces very often have no cars parked in them, except for the usual aforementioned ghettomobiles. So maybe no harm is done by taking these spaces that would otherwise go unused.

post-6850965,Mr.Do,"Feb 13, 2021 at 12:14 AM","I was doing some driving tonight, making pretty decent money when at about 9PM I got a phone call. Normally I have my calls screened so that if the number is not in my contact list it goes straight to voice mail, but I happened to have that switched that off because I was making some banking calls earlier in the day. I had a PAX in the car at the time so at first I ignored it, but then the call came again. So against my better judgement I answered. I am paraphrasing here a little bit but the person on the line said he was calling from Uber support and that since I was a stellar driver Uber was going to give me $500. I told him I had a fare and he said he would call back. 10 minutes later he did. He repeated his claim that he was going to give me $500. I parked the car and he proceeded to give my instructions on how to claim my cash. This involved changing the listed phone number in the app to one I did not know and then adding a debit card number to my cash out list. I went along with what he told me to do, but all the time I kept thinking something is not right. Before he could finish the process I hung up on him and tried to call Uber support. But of course it was in the evening and they are closed until Monday. Al the time the number came up again several times and then I got a text stating to call him back when I was ready to finish verification for my money. I am not going to do anything until I can verify this guy is who he says he is by calling Uber support Monday when they are open.

Was this a scam?? I don't know. But there is an old saying. ""When something seems to be to good to be true, it probably is."" Also, if you get a phone call in the middle of the night with a person wanting to give you money, alarm bells should be ringing.

I am pretty sure I almost lost a weeks worth of pay by cashing out to a strange debit card number. I am glad I wised up in time.

So this is a heads up to all drivers, there is some sort of scam targeting drivers out there. Beware of unknown calls offering you money.",2021

I am reminded of this as it is snowing hard right now on my night shfit. Cars would be turning from the main street into a side street that was unplowed... and would get stuck immediately. I am reminded of seeing roaches simply walking into a roach motel as a kid. It was so sad. I carried a shovel with me in the car, because I knew what would happen. 

I was able to save a few people by helping them dig out in between deliveries and pickups. But I definitely could not save all of them. When I did have one pax in my Uber, another car did swerve in front of me and almost hit us and slid backwards into a ditch. It was probably just a few feet away. I was driving so slowly so I was able to avoid him/her. It was the first BIG snowfall in Chicago in many years, so I suppose that people were not used to it. 

It was really sobering to see all the stuck cars. I myself only stuck to the main roads which were well plowed, and avoided any side streets which were not well plowed... Wait times I heard from pax were over an hour around 3:00 am. I was in a far suburb. When I picked some of them up, they were really grateful that someone was still out to get them.

I don’t know if it’s even appropriate to . It involves someone who passed away from a drug overdose and it might be triggering to some.

This story happened about 6 years ago in San Francisco. It was a chilly night with no fog and a stiff breeze. It’s about 1am that night, I think it was like a Tuesday or something. Basically dead on the ride front. Anyways, as I’m sitting waiting for a ping I notice a guy in a nice suite slumped over on the corner of the sidewalk. People were passing by, and just stepping over him. Being in San Francisco there is homeless people and drug use everywhere so people are immune to this kind of stuff, but something was off. He had a suite on and looked different from the everyday bum. I told myself “don’t worry about it he’s just drunk” I was telling myself not to go over and check, but I’m looking at this dude not move and looking stone cold dead so I decided to get out of my car and go investigate. Well, turns out he’s alive, barely. I shake him awake and he’s moving and grumbling some nonsense. I call 911, which in San Francisco isn’t very useful. The operator on the line is asking me “sir is he breathing”. I’m trying to convey to her that he’s moving, but I think he’s just drunk or something. She says something that would ultimately cost him his life. She asked me “Sir do you want us to send an ambulance? We get a lot of these calls and if he seems ok maybe you can take him to a hospital if it’s safe for you” I was a bit surprised by that response. I was just asked to put him in my Lyft and drive him to the hospital. I end up rolling him over, he’s younger maybe 34, a good looking and clean cut Asian dude. I carry him to my car and sit him upright. He’s fumbling over, but I manage to strap him in my back seat. I start driving him to the nearest hospital ER. While we are driving I’m asking what his parents number is so I can let them know he’s in the hospital. He hands me his phone and after not unlocking it I’m forced to use his finger print to unlock it. I get in his phone and it’s all in a different language. I find a number he last texted in I message and copy it into my phone. I finish driving him to the hospital. I turn around and look at him and he’s dead. Like straight up eyes rolled back, dead. I run in to the ER heart pounding out of my chest thinking Jesus Christ I have a dead man in my car. The ER lady at the front desk hits the emergency button and a team of people rush out with a gurney and load him out of my car and wheel him into the ER. I don’t know what to text to the number, who it is or what I should say. I ended up saying “I found a man, and took him to the hospital, found your number in his phone” said my name and the hospital he was at and that was that. I get a call back a week later. It’s the person I texted. The man tells me the guy passed away from a drug overdose and mentioned he was his boyfriend and that the guy was depressed because he had just lost his law license and had a drug problem and they had just broken up. The boyfriend cried, but seemed almost relieved mentioning he had been a major burden on people. Like dang dude, he just died and your still gonna talk bad about him. Definitely a bad break up. It got weird after he offered to have my girlfriend and I have dinner at his restaurant for free for trying to save of his ex. He said this after he finished crying on the phone as I told him about the guys last moments. Anyways, this still haunts me to this day. Always get the ambulance if your unsure don’t let 911 convince you otherwise.

The PAX walk past the sheriff's car and get in my car. Place is usually still pretty packed at this time, the parking lot is pretty much empty.

We pull out and as I am going down the side road toward the main road I pass a couple more deputy cars heading toward the restaurant. Lights were off.

I'm like I have no idea, I'm not speeding and I made sure I came to a complete stop at both stop signs I went through.

I pull over and start getting my license, registration, and proof of insurance ready, turn on the interior lights, roll down all the windows and place my hands on top of the steering wheel.

She gets to the rear passenger window and looks in and says you are not the car we are looking for you can go. Before I know what is going on she is back in her car and driving off.

Turns out the PAX tell me some guy came in yelling and screaming and threatened to kick every ones ass and shoot up the place. Caused the place to empty out pretty quick as last call was at 2:00 and they close at 2:30. Explains why the parking lot was so empty.",2020

Are you a hobby driver? Do you know who these guys are? Well...

I recently relocated to Tucson (sun-bird central), but still fly now and again for work, so (of course) use RS...the drivers picking me during day hours (not night) are kindly retired ""old-timers"" who drive all leisurely and seem oblvious to what they might make (or not make) per ride.

An example.

Me: Hey, I also do RS, hows it been going for you in Tucson?

Ernie: Oh, you know, I dont know, I just do it now and again, get a break from the mrs, its good to get out of that place at least one day and see whats going on out here, hehehe.

Me: Oh cool, ok, good to make some money too. Are there rides you tend to prefer or avoid?

Ernie. Nope. I just drive whatever, I go where-ever, pick up anyone.

Me: Whoa, thats different, because...for example, I avoid Walmart, I dont make enough money on those, having to load and off load 2 carts of groceries.

Ernie. Ohhhhhh I dont mind those, but I cant get out to help, because of my back and my knees.

Me: But...the wait, like, they only pay us 6 cents a min? Mann, I cant work for that, can you?

Ernie: Is that what they pay? I didnt even know...how much do they pay per mile? I dont much pay attention to these thing you know, I just drive, need to get out of the house once in a while, but not too long, or wifey might think I have a girlfrend, ahhahha!


I took Ernie's number, he was cool, friendly and I could call him direct for my airport runs, and put 100% of the fare in his pocket, though he probably ""doesnt care"".

I've noticed that pax have going bonkers on the multi-stops and grocery store PUs during the pandemic AND because these rides keep coming and coming, I figure enough drivers are accepting these PUs (otherwise RS would drop them OR offer drivers more money)....I wont touch these PUs, and dash them away... I used to wonder WHO picks up my left-overs.. it seems these hobby drivers happily take them.

I figured that there would be 2 parties and 2 or 3 pax would get into my Uber. But all five approached, only 1 was masked, and a guy tried to open my passenger side door...

(Potential pax): ""Could you please open the door?""
(Me): ""Ummm... how many are in your party?""
(Potential girl pax): ""5 of us""
(Me): ""Ummm... there can't be anyone in the front seat.""

(Me): ""Can you please order an XL?""
(Potential girl pax): ""We can't find one""
(Me): ""How about two UberXs?""
(Potential girl pax): ""Please can you fit all of us?""
... I'm really thinking here then why didn't they order 2 Ubers, but I realized this crowd was a few cards short of a full deck at this point... and this was the kind of bizarre behavior I would have expected over a year ago, but now? Where were these people living? I am now thinking that there was more than just alcohol involved in their past social gathering.

My very next request was a ping to the Elmhurst Police Station. I figured immediately it was a DUI situation, as it was 4:00 am in the morning. When I got to the pickup location the pax was nowhere to be found. Then I received a text message:

(Potential pax): ""Could you pick us up? We are walking down 1st Ave (I think it was 1st Ave)""
(Me) ""I don't know where exactly you are, could you give me a cross street or address?""
(Potential pax): ""We don't know where we are, my buddy got a DUI and we are walking home""
(Me) ""Then why did you order an Uber?"" (I was only 5 minutes from the pickup location so it wasn't as if they were waiting long for the pickup)
(Potential pax): ""I dunno, but we are walking down some street and there is a stoplight in front of me""
(Me) ""Sorry sir, that does not help me...""
(Potential pax): ""Well, we are almost home now, could you cancel the ride? We are so sorry to bother you""
(Me): ""Well, you should cancel the ride""
(Potential pax): ""OK, good night""
(Me): ""OK, bye!""

Haven't been driving much but went out today. Pings have been awful but stacked. AR is perpetually less than 70% because of ridiculous pickup distances and awful ratings (4.43 being one).

Stacked ping in the hood, 4.6x. Declined. Immediately after, 5* in another bad neighborhood (but not as bad, lots of college kids).

Account holder was a woman, I picked up a dude that looked like he's not unfamiliar with corrections. The trip was 98 miles (about an hour and forty minutes), northern Virginia. I didn't see a ""45+ minute trip"" on the ping.

Debated whether or not to take it, my gut said no. As always with these trips, I discussed a tip and we agreed on $20. He said his girlfriend's son was in the hospital.

With 53 minutes left on the trip, his girlfriend called and asked if ""y'all are okay"". I said yes, gave her our ETA. He was asleep.

Five minutes later, on the highway, the trip was canceled.

I woke him up, told him what happened, and said I would drop him off at the next exit. ""No, you'll take me back to where you picked me up!""

Negative &#128514;

He was cool after I explained that I had no idea what happened with his girlfriend and I don't drive for free. He said his phone only works on WiFi and I dropped him off at a McDonald's, about five minutes after the trip was canceled.

As I was on hold with support for this incident, I noticed that I had received a 1* for ""Service"".

post-6816125,Aw Jeez,"Jan 30, 2021 at 10:10 AM","Here in Pensacola, Florida, passengers often ask ""how I did"" during the worst of the pandemic lockdowns and such? They ask it in a concerned tone of voice, as if they assume I've done poorly. But I tell 'em, ""Great!"" The truth is that I did not miss a day of work, *and* I did not see any loss of business. I attribute this to two things:

1) There are plenty of people in my town who *had* to work - those employed by convenience stores and fast-food joints, nursing homes and restaurants...in other words, ""essential"" or exempted businesses. Many of my passengers were from a (ahem) lower-income strata of society and to work. But also, many of them did not have cars and have come to rely on R/S to get to and from work.



2) I assume that a lot of Uber/Lyft drivers are older, and many of them may have ""health issues,"" otherwise, they'd all probably have regular jobs. My thinking goes that because many(?) R/S drivers fall into one or more ""at-risk"" category, they stopped driving out of, as they say on TV, ""an abundance of caution."" End result: Fewer drivers on the road competing for the rides.

Whatever the actual reasons, I did not have to stop driving nor did I lose any income at all in 2020. I hit all of my admittedly modest daily income targets, and I found that I could achieve them in fewer hours per day than in the pre-pandemic days. Most days, it was non-friggin' -stop...ping-ping-ping. I worked hard all my life; I did not take this ""job"" so I could work hard some more.. Sometimes I'd kind of feel guilty about stopping early and ""abandoning"" passengers who needed rides. But after my second beer, those feeling passed.

I am only able to drive nights and early mornings for good reasons so my experiences are often 'fun'

So, picked up a pax, black woman who was doing at-home care that kept me waiting for two minutes but she apologized as soon as she got in the car so I thought nothing of it as she seemed nice.

We made our first stop at a gas station nearby that took her 8 minutes, she got in the car and I was driving to her destination when her tone did a 360° flip and she harangued me for following the GPS route which was only 15 seconds and one turn away from the only possible, logical subsequent route.

She was really turning nasty and irrational even as I pointed out the route was the fastest and lowest milage possible of three options on waze & uber nav so I pulled over, cancelled the ride and asked her to leave my car.

She refused, unleashed a further torrent of abuse so for the first time ever after 1500+ rides I called 911 to get her out of my car.

I gave the operator an accurate description of my car with hazards on and a squad car blew right past my vehicle even after me flashing my hibeams.

Two more 911 calls of police fail (gods help me if I am ever being assaulted!) and an hour later another uber arrived and she got out, maskless after calling me among other insults a n word.

I called diamond support with my story, informing them that I had dashcam footage of the whole trip but they said that they could not expunge the 1* she gave me.

I drove to the nearest cop shop and a Sgt stated that no crime was committed as I initially invited her into my car despite me repeatedly telling her to leave.

post-6795979,#1husler,"Jan 23, 2021 at 12:25 PM","I'm usually much more vigilant, even militant, about this, especially during Friday and Saturday night driving, which is drunk and druggy prime-time around here. For example, if I roll up to a bar, club, at night on weekends, I'll make very sure that a pax doesn't look too wasted before I unlock and I let them in my nice car, to lower the chances of them throwing up, getting too belligerent, etc., just being in insufferable pain the butt.

So I have no idea how and why I let my guard last night, but I did.

I rolled into a higher end residential neighbor (not bar or club) for a PU, parked, and was fiddling with my phone, not paying close enough attention to my environment...some how I left the car doors unlocked.

The next thing...I heard the door open, I said hi and introduced myself, then turned my head to see two women straining to hoist this big (6' 2''?), burly semi-conscious drunk into my nice car. ""Oh, hell no, ladies"", I responded, ""seriously, you can't...."", ""thank you...bye...."", they cut me off, then took off, leaving this incoherent drunk, who slouched horizontally across my backseat and went to sleep, even snoring.

I checked the ride and...it was long, like 20+ mins, but most of it on the interstate, and at least it was another residential (not commercial) address so, I could probably get him out the car and to the doorstep, or on his lawn. He was too blasted to be any trouble to me, though he might throw up in route.

I decided the quickest route out of this situation would be to simply, hustle him from point A to point B.

That's what I did.

I gunned it up the 1-10 to cut the time, got him to the address....parked, and woke him up.

He was still too sloshed to talk but...looked slowing around, seemed to recognize his place and pointed at it and grinned.

Ok, great, I helped him out the car, and luckily the 15 min ""cat nap"" revived enough of his motor abilities that he could sorta make a slow zig-zap like walk to his house without my help (I wanted as little end game involvement as possible)...I watched him enter, ended the ride, then got the hell outta there, logged off and went home- No more Friday night drunks!",2021

“really?”

“yep”

“well let’s go past anyway I want to see for myself”

I drive over and the place is dark... dark enough we don’t have to get out.

“ok can you call the ihop on east colonial and make sure they are open?”

Ok...

find it call in in... they are open!

Ok yeah ihop..

I drive him down to the ihop..

if I buy you breakfast Will you turn the meter off?

(oh look an offer for free food, yeah I ate a. HOUR before)

“Sir that’s a really nice offer but I just ate.

“oh well here you go, keep the change”

“Can you come back at 4;00? I don’t want to pay to have you wait.” (Currently 3:15)


I look at the dispatch computer.. there ain’t shit, it’s 3:15 am and covid is making mornings extra lousy with the lack of people flying.

yeah sure .... (why the hell I said yes to this is a total mystery)

So I arrive back and another 5 minutes to get him loaded:

“Oh shit” I hear in the back.

“Everything ok back there?” I ask afraid to ask.

“I think I’m oozing out of my leg”.

🤢🤮

Not “bleeding” OOZING!

what oozes?

Well any pus filled whatever I don’t want it to think about.

I get him back to the motel and out of the car and there’s a streak across the seat that starts snot green and transitions smoothly into bloody red.

4T.

it’s accompanied by w fleet wife messfage.

4t going to Mco

so great it’s like a $40 airport fare I’m nearby and can’t take it due to the... pusy bloody mess.

I make it to the shop and top off the tank, my phone goes off.

“Hey Stevie there’s no one else close can you get that airport fare it’s like w $40 fare.

While the way we run our business can differ greatly, it is fair to assume that it only makes sense to accept those with promised tips. 

Contrary to my belief, it looks like there are always drivers who love taking unprofitable offers that we would decline in a split second probably because of the combination of more rookies / desperate drivers / add any plausible causes here. As you may know, Home Depot, Apple and Best Buy deliveries are basically community service (long trip + $0 tip). To test the hypothesis that low-ball offers are never left behind, I have tried bidding a few. Sometimes when I was still reading the details (dimensions, weight, etc), the offer had already expired :eeking:!!

Can there be a possibility that I may have missed something? According to my experience, never expect a dime of tip if a customer does not offer any upfront although there can be miracles.

post-6754899,Cvillegordo,"Jan 10, 2021 at 10:10 AM","I have a regular pax that I have driven to/from her work as well as a few other places over the past year. She lives in the housing projects, she is quiet and polite - most of the time. On a couple occasions I drove her together with a friend, and she was a different person; snippy and somewhat rude. Since I encounter other snippy and rude pax, this didn't really bother me. However, two incidents made this a problem. About a week ago I got a ping to pick her up a few blocks from her home. The address is a location where there have been a half dozen shootings in the past month, also public housing. I stopped on the street and carefully monitored my surroundings including the large parking lot of front of the apartment buildings that I assumed the pax would come from. I waited about two minutes and a young man approached across the grass, said ""Lyft?"" I answered ""No."" and got this in reply; ""Then get your b.it.ch as.s out the street."" I immediately obliged and left, canceled and got the fee. I got an immediate phone call from the pax; I told her what happened and she screamed; ""That's my brother!"" Too bad. 

This past Saturday night, I got a ping to pick her up at her workplace. When I arrived, after a couple minutes four young people, two girls and two boys (my regular was not one of them) came running out, laughing, all carrying several large bags from the closed store. I suspected they had just enjoyed a private no-charge shopping spree, but I'm not going to judge. They surrounded the car and began yelling, talking excitedly and yanking on my door handles. Only one was wearing a mask. I called out; ""Sorry! Maximum three passengers. Masks required."" This resulted in an immediate chorus of vociferous verbal abuse. (Flashback to a couple hundred traffic stops.) One maskless young man approached my door and pressed his body against my partially open window and proceeded to give me some serious hood eyes and attitude. I repeated the rules, realizing that he was very close to attacking me, called out ""Watch your feet!"" and pulled away quickly. As I did he threw a handful of something in my face, most bounced off the window but a couple hit me. (Throwing a ""missile"" at a moving car in Virginia is a felony.) The ""missiles"" turned out to be French fries, but I have gotten this offense charged before for rocks, gravel, a book, a bunch of keys, and an apple to name a few other ""missiles."" 

I went around the corner, canceled and got the fee. Called support, described the incident, they escalated to another team immediately and I described everything again to a very articulate, intelligent sounding support rep. Within half an hour I got an email saying that I would not be matched to this person again, and then a bit later another email adding that she had been banned from the platform. Satisfying, but I wonder how long that ban will last? Also, since I have taken several other pax to/ from this girl's workplace, chances are good that I'll see her again. That will be interesting. The most annoying part of this to me is that in spite of two dangerous incidents involving residents of the same housing projects, and in spite of multiple shootings in that location recently, I'm guessing that if a pax complains that I would not pick them up because of their race, I'll get deactivated. Do me a favor I suppose, but I do enjoy having this part time gig available. My cancelation rate is going to continue to climb",2021

post-6776033,Young Kim,"Jan 17, 2021 at 2:27 AM","So I was in the west side of Chicago which is a relatively dangerous area doing an Uber Eats order for a burger king. (The delivery just completed at 1:27 a.m.) When I made the delivery the lady came down and said could you please deliver it to some other address. So I told her let me GPS it and find out where it was. She gave me an address that was about 7 minutes away by cicero and Chicago avenue.

Since the delivery address could not be changed on the app she suggested that she could pay me in cash. I agreed because there was no real way to change it through the app anymore. When I asked her how much should be willing to pay she surprised me and said $30! I seriously thought she was just going to offer $5 because it wasn't very far.

So she pulled out a $20 bill and 10 singles and just handed it to me and said *you look like someone I can trust.""

so I just exchanged phone numbers with her so that I could contact her when I got to the delivery location so her friend could come down and retrieve the food. The delivery went without a hitch and she took me even tipped me more on the app afterward!

This was quite a surprise so I just wanted to share this. I was surprised that somebody would be so willing to trust someone after the delivery was complete ...and also offer such a enormous amount of money for such a short distance. I'm glad that I give off that vibe that I am a trustworthy person.",2021
post-6762397,Young Kim,"Jan 12, 2021 at 3:57 PM","I had a pax last night who I picked up from chipotle restaurant. she was telling me about how her manager cannot get anybody to work because the unemployment was extended another 11 weeks.

She was upset because most all her co-workers decided to take the unemployment but for whatever reason that I couldn't figure out, she did not get it herself. She said her manager was quite upset because he couldn't get enough workers. And she was not happy that she picked up all these extra hours that she really didn't want because her manager asked her .......that someone HAD to do those hours.

She was also upset at us Uber drivers as well... She doesn't drive and she uses Uber exclusively to get to work and from work back to home. These days she has to wait up to 30 minutes to get an Uber, so to be safe she plans one full hour earlier for her commute.

I tried to defend all the workers on UI because maybe they all either need a vacation and/or are scared of the virus. 
She wasn't having it at all... She called all of us lazy and all of her co-workers lazy. This made me feel sad...

post-6733063,Young Kim,"Jan 4, 2021 at 5:42 AM","So tonight (Sunday), I went out after tutoring a student in math... and got a ping that was twenty minutes away, by Lake Michigan. I was about to cancel but I got a phone call from the pax. I answered and there was a frantic voice on the other end:

(pax): ""Please save us! We are stuck in the Chicago Botanical Gardens!, and we have a child in a stroller...and we are freezing!""

(me): ""What is going on?!""

She explained that when the Chicago Botanical Gardens closed, she, her boyfriend, and her baby left thinking that they can easily get home. She tried to get an Uber and Lyft, but all cancelled... one after another after another. She had been out in the cold with her boyfriend and child for nearly an hour. She said they were freezing in the cold, and sounded totally desperate. She said her and her boyfriend's phone was about to die, and I was basically the last hope.

They saw some light show at the Botanical Gardens, and the place had closed a while back... I agreed to get them. I drove the twenty minutes from like west of Northfield to the gardens. When I got there, I saw that the entrance road INTO the gardens was closed! I called her and asked her where she was and that I could not get in.

She sounded increasingly frantic, and said there was no one there around them to ask, and it was so dark. I guess all the staff left, and they were all alone. She could not make out anything except that her boyfriend and baby and her were next to a big lit up Christmas tree. I then put my hazards on, and drove around until I saw an open road (but it was an ""exit only"") road. It was one way the wrong way... but I went anyway because it was private property, and there were no other cars anywhere, so I could see if there would be a car driving towards me...(e.g. I drove through one of the exit roads that led OUT of the gardens, and into the park.

I drove around for a bit looking for them, and she stayed on the phone while I drove. I could not see any lit up Christmas tree... The Chicago Botanical Gardens is HUGE, and finding a few people in the dark seemed hopeless. She said she and her boyfriend were getting completely panicked, because the boyfriend's phone was about to die, and hers was as well. I said I would continue to search, and said I would find help.

As I drove around for a while, I finally saw a car in the distance with a man wearing a shirt with those yellow florescent strips on it. I was so happy to see him, as there seemed to be NOBODY else in the park. I think it was around 11:00 pm at night. I drove right up and explained the situation. I put her on and she told him about the surroundings....

He immediately knew where it was, and said he would drive there and have me follow him. So I did...

About a minute later, we both saw them! and the baby stroller...

They ran up shivering. They both thanked me and the man who helped me find them. After getting in, she explained again how she requested and got cancelled on... again, and again, and again.

She said I was like a savior today (like a ER doctor, firefighter, or other rescue worker). She said that without me, they were about to completely panic, as they saw no other way to get home. I drove them about 20 minutes to Rogers Park, IL to their apartment. She told me her life story which was so interesting and full of adventure. She was 25 years old and inexperienced about life. She thanked me over and over again about my not cancelling on her, and how I was so great because I did not give up on her, her boyfriend, and her baby boy. She said that Christ answered her prayers today. She explained that she saw no other way of getting home if it were not for me.

When the ride ended, I showed her and her boyfriend a few magic tricks like this one that I thought the young child would like:

post-6765165,The Gift of Fish,"Jan 13, 2021 at 12:36 PM","A while back I did the Santander Uber lease (I know, I know). A year into the lease the car was totalled by another driver and, because he was underinsured, Uber's insurer at the time (James River) paid me the value of the car.

James River assessed the value of the car at $23,000 and Santander said the payoff amount (or the money still owed to them in the lease contract) was $21,000. James River said that they would send the settlement to Santander, whom they expected to deduct the payoff amount and send me the $2,000 balance.

When I got in touch with Santander to let them know what was happening, they claimed that, since the car belonged to them, they would be keeping the whole settlement from the insurer.

I responded that, although they owned the car, I owned the insurance policy and was the insured and beneficiary of it, not Santander. I told them that a lienholder is entitled to their financial interest in the asset; not a penny more or a penny less. However, Santander insisted that they would take all the money.

I called James River again. The said that Santander's position was highly unusual. They told me the same as I told Santander - I was the insured and was the one entitled to the settlement, less any lien balance due. They agreed to send Santander a check for the payoff amount and a separate check to me. The loss adjuster said that this was the first time he had ever had to do that. 

I phoned Santander to inform them that I had bypassed them, that they'd only be getting the $21,000 and that they should be grateful for it. I never heard from them again.

My question is: has anyone else ever come across such a scam attempt by Santander or other finance house when they have a lien on your car and your car is totalled out by an insurer for more than the payoff amount?",2021
post-6770295,#1husler,"Jan 15, 2021 at 1:11 AM","2021 seems to be the year that pax are determined to take bizarre and unexpected trips with RS (ie, conning an unsuspecting driver to go through a drive through COVID testing site, etc) inclusive of trying take a Uber into Mexico!, how do I know? Well...

Yesterday I got ping in Tucson, did the PU only to see that the pax was going to the Arizona/Mexico border at Nogales, about 90 mins down the I-10. He asked me if it was ""ok""?, and I decided I'd go for it, because I had time, its a beautiful drive and a neat place.

On arrival at the border at Nogales, the pax informed me that he wanted to me to drive him across the border into Mexico, and then another 4 hours to Puerto Penasco (Rocky Point), and would pay me $300. It seemed a bad idea for a number of reasons, such as...that road is in very poor condition (a storm washed it away years ago), the wait to re-enter the US is looong, oh and my car isnt insured in Mexico, etc., etc.

So, I declined the offer, and instead advised the pax about how to take bus from the Mexican side of the border, left him there to cross on foot, did my shopping, then drive an hour up to Green Valley/Happy Valley to get rides up back to Tucson.",2021

When I inquired about this, I was told about a driver in this market, whom she and other drivers apparently know as the notorious ""Lyft Nazi"" (not to be confused with the notorious RBG).

She said that, this driver of infamy will pull up and crack the window just enough to bark out a laundry list of rules and regs (ie, stop where you are and listen, mask on before you approach this car, seat belt on immediately you enter, no food or drinks in the car, my music, my directions, etc, etc), then inform you that if you dont agree ""you can find another ride!, because its my car and you are my guest!"".

She said she and her buddies DONT like the Lyft Nazi, and were always one starring this dude and complaining...but that he's still out there plying our roads....I'd think, he more or less has ""the right"" to state his TOS and pax can consent or not, none of this technically conflicts with Lyft TOS, so he'd be good to go...just that his rating would plummet, but then he'd get deactivated for that too, right?

I had never heard about anything like the Lyft Nazi, yes...I'll remind a pax to dash on a mask, tend to ignore ""music requests"", I'll sorta tolerate and humor persons wanting to ""give me directions"", and whether they buckle up on the backseat or not is not my problem (Im not a kindergarden teacher)...of course, no eating in the car, no no no.

I dont know if the Lyft Nazi reads these forums?, but...Lyft Nazi, are you out there? Can you tell us know more about your mode of operation? Perhaps...you're dealing with pax PTSD and this is your reaction? Or, how and when did you develop this strategy? Can you tell us more please?",2021

post-6762937,Young Kim,"Jan 12, 2021 at 6:45 PM","I picked up a pax from Rogers Park, IL and brought him to the West Loop at a Hilton hotel. He was an overnight cleaning manager. He told me this remarkable story...

He met a woman who he fell in love with in the Philippines in 2004. They professed their undying love for each other and promised to marry. But........he was a cruise ship worker, and was gone for 10 months out of the year. So from 2004 to 2010, they saw each other just two months out of the year as he rode across the world. He shared with me exotic stories and how fun it was to be a cruise worker... and suggested that I personally would have a LOT of fun.. 

In 2010, he got married to his girlfriend in the Philippines. But he was still devoted to his job. His wife was quite unhappy about this... and eventually she ended up in the U.S., in Chicago as a CNA (certified nurse's assistant). They continued this long distance relationship, albeit with tremendous difficulty until this past year...for TEN years!.

In February of 2020, he discovered that his mother died suddenly of a brain aneurysm. He was distraught, and he quit his job and returned home to the Phillippines. After just ONE MONTH, his father died...presumably from a broken heart. Therefore, he quit his job as a cruise ship worker, and came to the United States, Chicago, to be with his wife............finally.

They now have a one month old baby....and his wife is taking time off as a CNA to take care of his daughter. Now he says he is really happy. But he really misses the cruise ship lifestyle... He did tell me that being away from his wife for almost the entire year was really hard and stressful on the marriage. He did say he had his own cabin because he was a supervisor, and there were many temptations.... He did relay the message that cruise ship workers get down with each other all the time. I did NOT ask him personal questions... I knew it was not my place to do so, but I sensed...

Should U/L be dealing with these places? If so, then I'd think we'd need a protocol that...if we're to PU from a potential COVID patient from a COVID testing, we'd need to be informed, and for those who ""opt in""... given some kinda ""hazard pay"".",2021

PAX asked me if I could go to pick-up point and pick her up a lighter and deliver it to her hotel as she needed a lighter, the hotel had none and her kid was in the pool. She would tip me the cost of the lighter plus $5.00.

These requests are normally scams, however they usually want beer and or cigarettes or things totaling a bunch more than a $2 lighter. I tell her I'll do it if she sends the request via a message in the app to cover my butt with Uber.

She sends a message right away and tells me to call her when I arrive and she will come to the car and get the lighter.

Okay, what do I have to lose, I'm heading that way anyway. Plus I have several lighters in my car that PAX have dropped on the floor or seat. I grab one of those lighters, start the trip as I near the gas station, and deliver the lighter. She was pretty nice eye candy in her bikini along with several other hotties at the pool. Walks up to my car and hands me $10 and says thanks. Told me I was the 4th driver she contacted, all the rest said no and cancelled the ride right away. I told her it was a typical scam and that is why I asked her to send the message.

The first one was a couple of guys that I picked up around kinsey and halsted in the west loop next to downtown Chicago. They put in the wrong pickup address which was a block away from where they were. Since it was so close I just drove there and then they came into the car. They got in the car and then when I swiped right I noticed the destination was their pickup location! 

So they got very very upset.... And asked me if I could change it and drive them anyway. I said no but they could change the address on their app... After that he got suddenly very upset and stormed out and slammed the door... I called out to him one last time and so sorry for what happened. But he just ignored me completely and went into atrium of his building...

The second rider was even more puzzling. At the end of the ride I told him so the ride is over thank you have a nice day and have a good night and I hope you have a wonderful rest of the year. He said thank you, and then he proceeded to walk around to the other side of the car, opened the door and then got in! (Fully expecting the ride to start!) 

I smiled a big grin and said sorry sir but we're at your home that's the destination that you put. He just sat there for a while...like 30 full seconds... and stared at me and then looked at his phone and called somebody and then got out of the car again and said thank you and have a good night!

post-6732381,MyJessicaLS430,"Jan 3, 2021 at 11:14 PM","First of all, my post has nothing to do with driving. Rather than posting on the chatter sub-forum, I would like to share this eye-opening experience from Xfinity with the largest amount of audience as possible.

Long story short, it takes numerous back and forth communications only to learn that the line in my new home is still registered with the previous tenant. It is not a news how incompetent Uber support is - reading scripts that are not relevant to the question. You think it is the worst customer support? Look at this Xfinity agent who kept me waiting for half an hour only to hang up :i'm mad:!!




$55 / mo!! Is this the service I deserve along with poor internet reliability? Because of the fact that the available competitors are racing to the bottom (as far as what I have heard), these companies couldn't care less about service quality or reputation.",2021
post-6729013,#1husler,"Jan 2, 2021 at 9:03 PM","To my friends from Lyft, why have you been peppering my inbox with these messages:


The reason I (and in fact, MANY drivers) dont accept some ride requests is because your ""platform"" remains riddled with a number of rides which pay significantly less than minimum wage.

I concur, its best for ""the community"" to score a return trip McD's drive thru run for $5.00 (and pay me $3.75 for 30 mins of my time, gas and car's wear/tear)... the community always appreciates a timely Walmart pick up to cram two shopping carts worth of groceries, a toddler, service dog into my car to drive .5 mile down the road and pay me $2.25 for that 20 min job....I know third parties dependent on outsourcing rides (with no tips allowed) for their patients who need drivers to drive them home, hold their hands and walk them to their resident doors, at times asking the drivers to open the doors and turn on the lights etc., which is awkward and risky.

Yes, those are few sample of the substantial number of missed ride requests to which you are referring. I will continue to miss them.

Why?, because I've hacked your ""platform"" by learning which rides (a few mentioned here) pay less than minimum wage so I can intentionally ""miss"" those ""ride requests"", and instead cherry pick those which pay more.

Like, for example, last night I got a ping to go to the Greyhound bus depot, only to receive a Uber ping for the airport. Guess which one became a ""missed ride request""?...I of course missed the request to go to the bus depot, because I never get tips from there, in contract to the airport (which are longer rides with tips).

I accepted a request from a drunken gentleman last night who wanted me to break down and load his bike into my car...which elicited a cancellation from me (I dont do bikes and avoid drunks in my car, because they've thrown up in there)...my next stop was a high end cocktail bar where I picked up a couple who gave them a $10 ride and received a $20 tip. I hacked your system to make $30 in 45 mins (that included driving to the drunken the bicyclist + canceling his ride). If I had done the Greyhound bus and the drunk bicyclist I would have make less than a 1/3 of that or less.

So you see, no I don't ""need a break"" (so kind of you to inquire) but rather...I just need to cherry-pick the low stress/low risk, high profit rides out of an otherwise rotten bunch. And yes, this will continue until you realize you cant cajole me into becoming an ant and de-activate me OR change your service delivery model

You have asked if I'm there for pax....and I'd answer the question with a question, asking if you (Lyft) are there for me to be there for pax?

If you sincerely have an interest in making your ""platform run smoothly"", there are a number of ways you could re-configure Lyft for the betterment of ""the community"".

First of all, you could peg a driver's wait time to $1.00 a min. Rest assured, I'd gladly do multi-stops, and wait in the car as long as needed. Secondly, you could up the minimum fare to $5.00. This might entice me to stop in and pick up at the grocery store, to drive pax one mile back home.

Or...if you are suggesting drivers offer social welfare services...you could simply have a 501 c 3 non profit arm, where you welcome us to volunteer x amount of their time to render services at low cost or even no cost...that way, I could drive a pax from the homeless shelter to the clinic and know that I'm doing it simply to contribute to society (not necessarily ""in it for the money"").

This might not solve all the issues between pax (ie, your ""community) and me...but it would go a long way to providing more dependable services (at least, from me) and would keep your platform running more smoothly.

Best.

post-6733017,Young Kim,"Jan 4, 2021 at 5:06 AM","So I'm working New Year's Eve after I did magic at a restaurant, (around 1:00 am), and was in Lincoln Park, IL. I was listening in on their conversation, and I heard the guy say to his wife, ""Our $400 bottle of wine was better than their so called $700 bottle of wine, don't you think dear?"" So I overheard them discuss the wine smoothness, flavor, etc. etc. And I chimed in:

(me) ""It seems you know quite a bit about fine wines. I can't tell because I am sort of allergic to alcohol. I heard that paying so much for a bottle really makes a difference right?""

(him) ""Of course it does!""

And then we discussed how the vintage year (I had known this before) is quite important, even more than the age of the wine. I shared with him that just because a wine is old does not mean that it is great, because the year the wine was produced could have been a bad year for grapes. He agreed and shared with me that 2020 will be an awful year for wines in California because of the fires. To make a long story short, he and his wife always bought extremely expensive wines to drink all the time. And their budget (for just wine) is more than most make in a week.

As I drove to a high rise in downtown Chicago, he and his wife shared with me that they used to go out and eat on most days before the pandemic, and always have breakfast, lunch, and dinner delivered since the pandemic closed many of the restaurants. He and his wife did share that they still often do go out because many restaurants will break the rules and allow in door dining for patrons who they know well.

The wife then warned me that if I go out to dinner with any girl, to not take them to Sephia. She said it was a ""tasting 7 course"" place in Chicago, and cost about $250 per person BEFORE the wine (which obviously they must have), so they spent $800 last they dined there.

He and his wife then told me I should go to a restaurant which I think was ""Everest"" in Chicago. They told me that it costs them over $1000 per meal there, but said it is so worth it. The wife said that there customer service is so good, that they have a person standing right behind you at all times, and the second you need to use the restroom, he pulls out the chair the moment your butt leaves it. Then they change the table settings of course...

We discussed a bit of their vacation habits, and I won't go into further details but it was all over the country and world. He said he was in Florida and now in Chicago and will be moving to Wisconsin next year... So I asked him:

(me) ""Let me guess, you are in a field of medicine?"" (Because he was moving around the country)

(him) ""Yes, Facial Plastics and ENT"" ""My wife is in the field of oncology""...

(me) ""I know that is an incredibly lucrative field, as if yours (to the wife). Now I know why you both can afford to go out so much and buy only the most expensive drinks""

(him) ""Yes, do you know about the field of medicine? You seem very smart.""

I then told him about how I went to medical school but quit and went into the financial world... and do magic, teach physics, and do magic on the side...

(him) ""Do you have any tricks with you?""

(me) ""I'll show you at the end of the ride""

I did the following trick, minus the suitcase because it would be impractical to open my trunk at the end... He was so surprised and loved it and his wife yelled out an expletive. It was a trick where I take a stack of one dollar bills, then change them into 100s. This was the trick... (I always tailor the magic to the passenger. I knew he and his wife would love anything to do with money).


I posted this story because I am reminded that even during times when people are about to be kicked out of their homes because they can't pay rent or their mortgage, others literally are swimming in money... So of sad...

(Also, just to add, even with the magic tricks... (I showed two more), he and his wife left no tip.)",2021
post-6708357,Young Kim,"Dec 26, 2020 at 2:23 AM","I wanted to post the story because I thought it was so interesting. Last night one of my passengers was coming from his apartment to the target by lincolnwood, illinois for his overnight shift. I started the conversation by mentioning how target treats their employees very well because I heard they're giving good hazard pay.

He replied that they are and that they're hiring now at his store in case I wanted to apply. We then talked about how during the holidays everybody's around family and I asked him if he was excited to be around his family. He told me he was from st Louis and he will only be spending it with his roommates.

So then I asked him if he will see his family on zoom. He replied that he would only see his sister and his niece on zoom. So then of course I naturally asked about his parents. There was a long pause... He reply that he hasn't seen his parents since he was 15 years old and he's 40 years old now.

I gauged how he looked in the rear view mirror...and then I just asked gently ""could I ask why you haven't seen him in so long? are they still alive?""

He then asked in a funny way ""is this taxi cab confession"" or a ""1 hour psychology therapy session?"" I replied that it was not and he felt uncomfortable sharing he doesn't have to...

After a long pause he said ""well I guess i'll tell you because I won't ever see you again for the rest of my life. And this is something that I wanted to tell my co-workers but I can't.""

What he told me is that he is irish and usually irish people are so close family-wise. But both of his parents were serious drug addicts who abused him mentally and physically. Shortly after he ran away from home at age 15, his sister ran away from home too. He said he has no plans to ever see his parents again and cannot forgive them for what they did to him. 

After he ran away from home he worked odd jobs and stayed at friends homes. he's very proud of what he has accomplished even though he's never gone to college. I wanted to share the story because it's very surprising that people will share their most intimate life secrets with their Uber drivers.",2020
post-6733635,FLKeys,"Jan 4, 2021 at 12:08 PM","Saturday night I picked up a PAX and in our discussions he tells me he needs a Uber to the Airport at 6:30 Sunday morning. I tell I'll be up and hopefully I get the ping. I like those Sunday morning airport trips.

Get up at 5:30 Sunday morning and check the rider app. No drivers online yet. I turn the app on at 6:00 AM. I head out the door as I want to pick up something for Breakfast. Before I get to my car I get the ping for a scheduled ride. I see the pick-up point is where I dropped the guy off and it is a 90 minute trip. Scheduled time, 6:15 to 6:30 leaves me enough time to get breakfast plus will insure I get the MAX long pick-up fee.

Less than a mile from my house I my app beeps and that dreaded there was a problem message pops up on the screen. I knew right away Uber was screwing me out of this trip. Sure enough trip was gone. Another 30 seconds go by and I get a ping for another rider. He was closer but still a long pick-up. I grab breakfast and head to pick them up. Had to make sure I got the most out of the long pick-up fee. His drop off was 1/2 mile from my house. Okay, that works.

1 minute after starting the trip I get another ping, the scheduled ride that they gave me before. At this point there is no way I will be to the scheduled ride by 6:30 as I have an 9 minute trip for the ride I just picked up and a 18 minute ride after that to the second pick-up.

About 5 minutes into the first trip I get another ping request, for the same scheduled trip I already accepted as a stacked ping. I'm thinking what the heck.

Ended up getting to the second pick-up at 6:50 am, 20 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time.

Rider is a little pissed off at this point. Says he saw me accept his ride. He got a there was an error message on his screen and I was gone and he got driver unavailable searching. After a while he got me as his driver again. He than got an update message from Uber that he has a different driver, a lady names Carla. About 30 seconds later he gets the there was an error message again. Searching for driver. Than I show up as his driver again.

I explained what happened on my end and we surmised that Uber put him on hold while they had me complete the other trip first, since no other drivers came online they gave me his trip again after I started the other trip. At some point Carla came online and they gave her the trip taking it from me without me knowing as I was doing another trip still. Carla must have cancelled right away so now the trip came back to me.

In the Driving Preferences on the Uber APP I have Trip Swaps turned off. I guess Uber just uses the were sorry there was a problem message to do what they want.

I got the guy to the airport on time, he was very thankful and ended up dropping me a nice tip later that night.",2021

Most of the students enrolled at Lynhurst Baptist Church Preschool in Indianapolis are children of parents who have worked as essential workers pandemic, and nearly all are from families that fall at or below the poverty line, according to the preschool's director, Renee Dixon.

And all 50 of the preschool's students, plus their siblings, received Christmas presents this year thanks to Dixon, who has spent her weeknights and weekends for the past year as an  and Lyft driver in order to make extra money to buy them gifts.

Dixon, who lost three of her own family members to COVID-19, said enrollment at the school, which serves kids ages 1 to 12, dropped in half during the pandemic as students' parents lost their jobs. She also had difficulty finding work as an Uber driver due to decreased demand, so she signed up as a driver with Lyft, too, picking up rides whenever and wherever she could.

""We are thrilled to see her heartfelt story getting national attention, particularly during a very challenging year,"" a Lyft spokeswoman told ""GMA"" in a statement. ""Lyft was originally created to help build and support communities through transportation so it is wonderful to see people like Renee take that spirit one step further for her students and their families.""

When Dixon earned $100 from her driving, she headed to Target to buy not only toys and games for her students, but also essential items like winter clothing. Faced with decreased earnings from Uber and Lyft, Dixon said she also took money from her own paycheck to buy items for her students.

""This year, with COVID and everything that has really been taken away from the kids, at no fault of their own, I had to do something,"" said Dixon, whose story was . ""The location of where the school is, it's not in the best neighborhood, but we make the best out of everything.""

Even with the odds stacked against her, Dixon said as of last week, she was able to raise over $2,500 this year to spend on her students.",2021

post-6723177,MyJessicaLS430,"Dec 31, 2020 at 3:57 PM","Knowing this question is probably market-dependent, will the pandemic be an additional factor for consideration? Learning from this forum that the best time to drive on New Year's Eve is between 11pm to 4am with the incredible surge in the past years, will that even be available this year?

Personally, I have quit Ubering since the removal of Select. With the paltry $3 here and there (if there are any), it does not worth my time anymore. On the New Year's Eve in 2018, I did a few rides with the last one taken before 10pm. That was a few weeks after Uber replaced the multiplier with flat surge. With the Select fare bringing an older couple to an upscale restaurant and their generous tip, I took home with ~$70 after 4 hours of work. I cannot imagine to only driving stingy people around with base X fares alone before the real money pours in past midnight ($14+ surge in Houston core).

Anyway, to those of you who will be driving tonight, stay safe and I wish you all make bank! A lot here has experience dealing with the drunks and obnoxious but you can only imagine the aggravations associated with the 'festival vibe'. I also know some here have no problems at all driving people unmasked which I respect an individual's decision. However, for those of you who do care, allow me to share this.

I pulled up to an apartment, where a couple of college age guys were clearly moving house, with all their household junk on the lawn...one mini-van was almost fully loaded, but a ton of stuff remained...then this guy runs up to my car and asks me to open the hatch....after some inquiry, he divulged that he wanted to load up my car (including the passenger seat), then I should follow him in the mini van to his new place. I give him my stock line about not being able to do an extended wait because I have ""another passenger"" in the queue, canceled the ride and piled out of there. Man.

post-6609740,Young Kim,"Nov 4, 2020 at 2:37 AM","I picked up a guy named ar"""""""""" by franklin park illinois. I took him for a 45 minute drive all the way to the south side of Chicago he said by englewood. (The screenshot I took was about 15 minutes into the ride right before I enter the eisenhower) But on my map it says something slightly different. His story was was that he was the father of five. He is only 24 years old though. He has the children with multiple baby mamas.

I asked him what he did to support them and he said he does not have a job but just sells drugs. He had been in jail before the last time was for armed robbery he did 6 months. He said that he has post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

when I asked him why, he said that because he saw his younger brother and his best friend get shot right in front of him. His best friend was shot once in the head and two times the neck. His brother was shot in the back and in the head. he has also been shot multiple times the last time they missed and shot him through his ankle. He was wearing a cast where he had ostensibly been shot. On his right arm.

He said that both were killed not because they had done anything really serious like kill someone directly. Or steal drugs or money or rat out someone. Rather, they were just pawns in another multiple scoring side game series. He said they are almost like teams on the NBA in Chicago. There's so many active ""games"" going on. but of course the object is not just for baskets but rather for people.


He said that and he used the words is kind of like a game of ""ping pong"" out here in the south and the west side of chicago. He said it's kind of like a game of chess as well. When one person takes a piece on one side the other person tries to take a piece on the opposing side. And there are sacrifices on both sides.

I thought that most of the killings would be drug related but he said that's not the case. He said that many killings are part of a larger game going on and a larger war where multiple battles go on in different areas. Where the object is just to knock out as many people on the opposing side. and you sacrifice some of your own members to get to the higher level members.

He said that often the killing is almost on a whim. He said that if you have a friend and somebody ""scored "" on one of his other friends and was "" blocked"", then you have an obligation to help him carry out a hit. He said that if you've just met someone then of course you wouldn't carry on a hit but if you became good friends and there was a score to settle then you would sort of have to join in.

He said that it is literally an active war zone and there's so many different battles going on at once. I asked him how many games there were and he said they're just too numerous to count.

He didn't say that there's any specific areas that are more dangerous than another. He said that you have to keep on monitoring who is on any particular corner at any given time. if you go to a corner where there's someone trying to score on your team. , Which means someone's trying to kill someone on your team, then you have to avoid that area. One ""score"" means that you killed somebody on the opposing team and a ""block"" means that instead of getting killed you were able to get at least one shot off onto the other person.

He said that after three successful blocks the person trying to score on you must by street principal avoid trying to kill you for at least one week. They can try again after week but then there has to be some kind of majority vote. On who can volley for the next attempted score.

He does not talk to his father as his father has been in jail for most of his life. But he does have 5-year goals which I asked about. He wants to move out of his grandmother's house and he wants to get a job as a busboy at olive garden.

well I told him that I drive sometimes on the south of the west side and I've never had any problem, he was not surprised. he said that if you mind your own business and don't wear any fancy jewelry or drive a fancy car, then in Chicago street principle everyone is supposed to leave you alone. If someone were to inflict serious harm to someone like me who is an outsider then said that other members would actively hunt that person down because I am not actively participating in any active"" street game."" He said that now that he knows me, he said I would be protected on certain areas participates in. He was Telling other members that he was talking to on his team about me and my car and then I was ""protected* from now on. He said that he is part of a rather large group connected to other groups and they would get the word out.

I asked him how hard it is to get a gun and he said that it's so easy that if I wanted one tonight and had a little bit of money I could just pick one up from him.

Of course, I don't feel any safer. After I dropped him off I logged off and I'm back in downtown right now. Common sense is of course i'd rather be in downtown but I do not actively avoid the south of the west side either.

I found this interesting because it was quite complicated and the killings and the settlings of different activities take place sometimes over many years.

post-6633848,_Tron_,"Nov 16, 2020 at 1:03 PM","I drive in a medium sized metropolitan area in California. Not a big city. Crime is relatively low. Smallish homeless population. The few protests that occurred this year were peaceful. None-the-less, for several years now across the board I've noticed that people are becoming edgier.... more stressed out... more angst ridden. People already on the edge have been falling off it.

But in the past few months, even in the typically docile communities I traverse in my rideshare car I am witnessing events I've only ever seen on TV. Take for example a recent morning run to McDonald's for morning coffee, which ended up in a showdown not dissimilar to the Seinfeld episode where George and another driver both claim the same parking space on a New York street. The drive-through has two ordering lanes which converge to a single lane. While placing my order in lane 2 an SUV abruptly pulls in to lane 1 and starts ordering. We both pull forward to the single lane to make payment around the same time, but I end up slightly ahead of the other driver. Still, he edges his vehicle close to the car in front of us waiting to pay. I am feeling a bit anxious myself and refuse to give any ground. The Lane 1 driver has his right window down. Conversation ensues...

Me: ""I was ahead of you sir.""
Lane 1 guy: ""No. I was already ahead of you and in line.""
Me: ""No, you weren't.
Lane 1 guy: Repeats his claim, and pulls his car forward another foot.
Me: ""OK. You win. Go ahead and go."" I back up a few feet
Lane 1 guy: He mouths off some more even though he had won. I don't recall the exact words.
Me: ""Go ahead. Clearly it's important to you to go first""
Lane 1 guy: ""Well clearly it's important to you too!""
Me: ""But it's clearly  important to you""

With that last sentence I have achieved a verbal technical knockout. The driver knows this and is so frustrated by it that he exits his vehicle and starts heading to my car, announcing in a threatening voice, ""Oh, you got something to say?"". I am of course trapped in the drive-through line with no escape. I am of retirement age and this guy is half my age, twice as big, and grossly overweight.

I roll the window part way up. Then with my left hand I retrieve the can of pepper spray from the door pocket and grab my phone with the other hand. I shout out, ""Get back in your car fatso or I'll mace you and call 911.""

The guy collects his senses and retreats to his car. Now the pay window is clear for us to pull forward. I announce to the other driver, ""I'm  going to let you go ahead"". He pulled ahead, infuriated. Later when I pulled in to traffic and got caught at the first red light there was the guy again, nearly next to me. He didn't see me though, and as the light turned green he was on his horn for the guy in front of him, who wasn't moving fast enough to suit him.

---
In another incident I was driving on a two lane road that necked down to one lane after an intersection. Traffic was heavy but moving with the green light. As I crossed the intersection suddenly a big diesel pickup (4-door, duallies) lunges forward from the cross street, which had the red light. The truck turns right and is now parallel to me in what is the merge lane just before the road becomes 1 lane. The driver is flooring it and you can hear the loud diesel laboring under the load.

I choose to give no ground (I am admittedly stubborn at times), thinking that as the roadway gets narrower and narrower the driver will eventually back off. But noooooooo. He keeps moving to the left until finally I have no choice but to either let him hit me or give up the lane. I was forced out of the lane and into one of those center type lanes that allow vehicles driving in either direction to make a left turn. I then eased in behind the giant truck.

After about a mile the pickup turns off on a side street. I was still pissed off enough that I decided to follow it and get a shot of the license plate to report the driver to the police for reckless driving. Big mistake. In short order the driver pulls over to a curb. I do likewise about four car lengths back. I'm thinking the guy is going into a nearby business. But noooo. Out pops the driver and heading straight for me. The dude is MASSIVE. The word ""monster"" actually popped into my mind. He was nearly as big as his truck. Giant bald head. You know the type. Except in this case his head sort of narrowed at the top and came to a crown. Like he was deformed or something. Kind of like the extra-wide version of Zippy the pinhead.

Walking toward my car, in a bellowing voice he shouts out, ""Do you have something to say, ********?"" I was so scared I sort of froze. Wasn't even thinking about the pepper spray, which easily could have easily backfired anyway. Like shooting a 22 at a Grizzly bear and simply pissing it off. The only thing I could think of was to act like I was photographing him and the truck. Maybe fear of the incident being documented would make him back off. It didn't. Worse yet, I couldn't find the camera icon on the stupid phone, so I was just pretending to photograph him and his truck. The dude came right up to my (fully closed) window. I ignored him, steadfastly pretending to photograph the scene. In frustration he slammed his fist against the driver's window and walked back to his truck. My whole car shook from the single fist pound. Why the glass didn't break I do not know.

There have been other unusual, over-the-top vehicle incidents lately as well. But all the other ones I've just backed away from. In greater numbers, people are losing their senses at times. And you simply can't argue with a crazy person.

Finally, there was this vehicle parked in a CVS parking lot....

post-6710321,Young Kim,"Dec 27, 2020 at 9:03 AM","So toward the end of the night around 4:00 a.m. saturday night I was in evanston and picked up a lady with a suitcase. I knew that of course she's going to O'Hare airport. She was very talkative and told me that she wants to tell me a story of true love.

She said that she's reconnecting with someone that she's loved for 45 years. She said that back when she was just a teenager she went on a date with this guy named larry in high school. Both of them were so shy back then that they didn't know how to spark anything up. 

Anyway, years past and he got married and she married some lawyer. They had three children. She said the first 10 years of the marriage were good but after that it fell apart as he got verbally abusive. Then later she found out that he was hiring prostitutes for many many years. She found this out because he accidentally called her phone and left a voicemail talking to one of the call girls that he was regularly seeing. She said she wanted to stick to her wedding vows and also for children so she still stayed in the marriage.

Then 3 years ago her husband was diagnosed with ALS. It progress rapidly. She stayed back from her job to take care of him during his final years. But in february of 2019 she was in jewel and she sent a random text to larry who was still an old friend of hers over the years. 

Larry replied to her that he's in the midst of getting a divorce. She informed larry that her husband is in the terminal stages of ALS and doesn't have long to live. So in february of 2020 he said that he's coming to chicago to visit a friend. as soon as she met him in his hotel room she said there was an instant connection and it was like she met her twin flame in this life. They made love that night and the following night. She said that it was dynamite and it was the best sex she ever had. 

She's then saw him in april then in june then in july and then in september. In september of this year is when her husband finally passed away. She confessed to me even though she fell slightly guilty about it that she was finally relieved that her husband had passed. It was hard taking care of someone with that disease but she wanted to stay true to the promise of taking care of him till the end.

however her children were very angry at her for having an affair while their father was still alive. But in her mind she felt that why should she feel not feel bad because the marriage had been ostensibly over 20 years ago when they were no longer in love. And the fact that she knew that he was having affairs himself with multiple prostitutes over decades., Made it easier to have the affairs because she knew that her husband was going to die anyway very soon.

I did not judge her but during the long ride to O'Hare from evanston illinois I showed her a couple of my magic tricks on my phone. She was so amazed and she said that she wanted my phone number so that she could invite me for her friends or for children's parties of parents that she knows. I said fine and I texted her my number. 

Then later before we left she said that if she was not meeting larry that she would have loved to gone on a date with me! As we left the ride she asked me that when she comes back in a week if we could have coffee.

She was 59 years old and she had a very nice figure skinny ...but I told her that there's no way I would do anything that might compromise her new relationship with larry. I don't think that it was a romantic gesture but rather because she felt that we had such a strong connection. Anyway we ended the ride very pleasantly and I wished her well and she said that she would keep in touch with me about what happens. After a few minutes I started getting texts with her though however.

I just replied that I hope this thing with larry goes well and that you both get married. I thought it was a fastening love story that after 45 years her who was named michelle and this new guy larry could be kindle their 45 year old gap where they knew that they loved each other all along. I did tell her that sometimes this kind of true love does last or take a very long time in this case for her 45 years. but I wish her well and I hope that this new relationship completely works out. And I told her that her children should be understanding and forgive her and be happy for her.",2020

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays y'all.

I'm interested to know where you guys fall on the Holiday Mood Meter this year? I'm finding myself in the mildly irritated range and that's making me even more irritated because I'm not sure why I'm irritated to being with.

I'm hoping it's just 2020 overload and it'll pass quickly.

So...what do y'all have planned for this year's holiday celebrations? Do you have your presents wrapped already and the tree decorated or are you going the Bah Humbug route? Are you more Buddy the Elf or the Grinch this year? Are there going to be fresh cookies and milk for Santa or is he getting a Slim Jim and warm, stale beer?

Well...whatever your mood and whatever Holiday you might be celebrating I sincerely hope every single one of you can find a bit of joy this season. Lord knows we could all use it.",2020
post-6553712,OldUncleDave,"Oct 5, 2020 at 5:08 PM","Many, I mean a LOT of pax are complaining about drivers accepting trips, then cancelling. Some have been trying to get home for 3-4 HOURS, with 5-6 drivers cancelling on them, even with the (California) multiplier of 4x and 5x.

Now, some of them I can understand, but my philosophy is, if you accept the trip, you should keep it. Maybe a 5 minute window to cancel, but it is about customer service. You cancel, now I have to deal with a pissed off pax, and try to calm them down, else I get YOUR 1* .

Last night, one of my last trips of the night. 6 mile to pickup, 30 mile trip, drop off was a mile from my house. SWEET!

As soon as I accepted, text message, ""Please don't cancel on me! I've been trying to get home for 3 hours!""

post-6705059,Germanic Affairs,"Dec 24, 2020 at 3:12 PM","I don't want to be negative in the Holiday Seasons. That is not my intent. Many of you work Uber because you have nothing. Many of you work Uber because you are unempolyable. Many work Uber because they are social outcasts. Many work Uber because they are lazy. Many work Uber because they don't have the ambition to do something else or the ability to use their brains to find something. Like I said I don't want to be negative and emphasize these type of problems, I don't even want to mention them.

Thing is, if you don't do anything things only get worst. Waiting for a miracle is silly. I keep hearing people say ""Thank God 2020 is over"" or ""I am so happy 2020 is finally over"". I merely ask a simple question. Why? Why is it good 2020 is over? What makes you think 2021 will get better? Why couldn't 2021 be even worse?

The only way to better yourself starts with yourself. Don't depend on others. You need to be the one that finds their way out of the trap. I hope with the Holiday Season you are all going back to school or starting school, or starting a apprenticeship or you are starting a job in something that you can get skilled or educated in something marketable or you are getting certified or licensed in something in demand.

Anyways have a Merry Christmas, go to church, confess your sins, and start the New Year's as a new human that is productive and worthy of society. That actually does something for humanity, not just applying for unemployment and accepting pings from your car all day.

Drove passengers for the first time in weeks this afternoon. People were driving like maniacs, as has been the case since the protests - cops seem to have mainly thrown in the towel around here. 

Was driving on I-64, saw a major collision on the opposite lane. Less than half a mile away, came up on a multi vehicle collision with an obvious fatality that had happened within minutes before. 

Had a passenger, felt powerless. Wanted to stop. Saw this poor elderly man dead and who knows about the other car, crashed in the median on the other side of the road. 

If not for me missing a turn because my pax was back seat driving, I would have likely been in the middle of this. Today wasn't my day (or my pax). Saw several other minor accidents heading home, driving carefully as I could. 

Always tell your loved ones that you love them before you leave (I always kiss my pup and tell my wife I love her, even if she's pissed at me for something), SLOW DOWN, and please be careful.

post-6683603,Young Kim,"Dec 16, 2020 at 6:04 AM","I was driving near Golf Rd, and Waukegan Rd around Morton Grove, IL when I got a ping request for UberEats (around $4 payout) at a place called ""Wings and Things"" on the app. It is a low offer but I saw that the pickup was only 1 minute away and the dropoff was just 2 minutes down the street. When I accepted, I immediately got a second ping from the same location. It was for $9 so I also accepted that. When I pulled into the parking lot, I could not find the name on the store window, but saw an open restaurant with the lights on. I confirmed the address number even though it was not the actual name on the front. I called out as there was nobody behind the counter. After awhile, a guy came out. I told him the two names on the order, a ""Dani"" and a ""George"".

I am usually very friendly with my greeting but this guy sort of ignored it and seemed like he was in a very bad mood. I recognized him from earlier deliveries and recalled his unfriendly nature. He curtly said that George was ready but Dani (the 4 dollar order), would be 5-10 minutes. I then very nicely explained to him that the Dani order was a 4 dollar order, and since it is not ready and the second one was on the counter and was a 9 dollar order, that maybe I should cancel that order and allow another driver to take it when the food is ready.

I very kindly told him, ""My friend, if the $4 order can be ready in 5 minutes, then I can wait. But if you think it will take 10 minutes or more, then maybe I will cancel and let another driver take it because it may not be worth it for me to wait?""

(Then he surprised me with the following words)

He abruptly said: ""I really don't care if you take either order because I get paid either way. When I click on the ""accept"" button then I get paid. If you cancel I don't care because I get paid no matter what.""

(and then the following words REALLY pissed me off)

He continued on in a proud entitled way, ""I want you to know that I really don't care at all what  make in tips""... ""Because I get paid...so whether you make nothing or something, ""

The reason why this last sentence really upset me is that he was so demeaning to all delivery drivers. He was not just targeting me, but . He acted so proud as if we delivery drivers were so unimportant to him and what we got paid, because he would be paid regardless. And he said it in such a rude manner. You had to be there to understand it.

I was surely going to cancel...but I remembered reading here on someone else's post that in fact what he said was true, that the restaurant gets paid by Uber whether the delivery is made or not. So I politely said, ""OK, if it will be a short while, then I'll wait."" and I smiled. In retrospect, I should have just cancelled probably, but I was already there, and in the back of my mind I wanted to let him know that I was a patient person and a polite person. After about 8 minutes, he came out with the food. At this point, I calmed down a little, but I tried to explain to him (and this is where many of you may disagree with me because I confronted him) that his words, ""I want you to know that I really don't care at all what you guys make in tips""... ""Because I get paid...so whether you make nothing or something, I don't care"" was rather mean and insensitive.

I said to him, ""Respectfully sir, I wish to tell you that I was not blaming you at all that the food was not ready or that the customer did not leave a decent tip, but rather the reasons why I may have wanted to cancel the order that was not ready. I thought what you said about delivery drivers in general and how you don't care what we get paid is mean and actually rude...""

But suddenly he raised his voice and got all defensive and spoke down to me in an insulting fashion, ""Look, you are not supposed to even tell me what you are getting paid. That is not your job. You guys' job is just to come inside, not say anything, get the food, and leave!""

I realized I was almost to lose my cool... I took a deep breath, and said, ""OK, thanks. Goodnight, and I wish you well and please understa......""

I could not finish my sentence because he just walked away out of sight behind a wall.

Surely if I ever get this location again I will reject the order. But I really had a passing thought of wanting to smack him. I recall I even clenched my fist for a moment. He was behind the counter in a very drab, sort of beat up fast food restaurant with no seating. Why would he act so proud and mighty and say rude and insensitive things to me and about all delivery drivers. He targeted all UE and DD drivers by saying, ""I don' care what you guys make, I get paid anyway"". I did not act angry that the food was not ready or that the customer's tip was lousy. I only tried to explain to him the reasons why I did not want to wait for the second order (indicating that for a tiny payout it may not be worth it if I had to wait a long time).

I am certain that other drivers have had similar experiences. I wish that Uber did not pay out the restaurant immediately like this. Then if I could cancel I may feel that if the food is not delivered then he would be affected. But if he is paid the instant he clicks ""accept"" then maybe this is why he acts this way to delivery drivers?

I did ""thumb down"" the delivery and gave a reason ""unprofessional staff"". I also called UberEats support on my way to the second order and complained. The rep took down my information and said she would forward it on. I tried to find the place again just now through Google to write a negative review to describe what happened to me, but the restaurant name was not even on the search when I typed in the name I recall on the app! I do recall the second order, at the exact same location, even had a different name for the restaurant! It was two words, ""Future"" and then another word. Since the orders are done, I cannot contact an UE support rep live to find the name of the restaurant.

Would you have been as incensed and pissed off as I was? I was disappointed because he acted so high and mighty and dismissive, even though I was so polite and said and did absolutely nothing to provoke him or accuse him of anything. It would be a different matter if I was rude to him first... in retrospect I think that in his infantile world he thought that when I said I may cancel the order if the wait is too long then I am warning him that if he does not produce the food soon that he won't get paid. I think that was what he thought, so he would prove his superior position by stating that he could not care if I did so because he is already paid. But I did nothing to suggest that. At all.

The shop I get my rental cab from also has a chauffeur business on the same business model more or less. Aside from booked chauffeur fares they are also on the Uber platform.

This morning I was talking to one of the chauffeurs and told me that he got deactivated off Uber for a bullshit face mask complaint.

In the middle of the ride he asked the customer to put her face mask back on then she accused him of not wearing a mask while driving her. This lead to him losing access to Uber.

“Dude that sucks, your not in trouble with Mears over that are you?”

No, this was a month ago and they just gave me a copy (company lingo for chauffeur fares) driving one of the execs today so I’m sure I’m fine.

“Makes me feel better about my Uber rating” I tell him.

“my friend eventually everyone gets false complaints. Don’t worry about Uber eventually we’ll all get kicked off.. I’ve been at Mears for 20 years and driving VIPs for 15. But I’m still dream team so don’t worry about Uber at all”

“wait your one of the guys who gets the Saudi princes and whoever?” I ask.

He just chuckled at me and nodded.

Yeah the guy who has been doing this for 20 years and is trusted with Saudi Princes gets a false accusation just because he politely asked her to put her face mask back on.

more talking later and he said that he only picks up a car on days that they have chauffeur business for him to do. I looked over his shoulder and recognized the name of his clipboard of his customer.

His name was ""B"", and we started out talking about how the economy and the job market is terrible. He told me the business for drug dealers is good. He then went on to tell me he sells a lot of adderall, weed, coke, and Xanax ""ladders"" (as he called them). ""B"" told me that regarding Empire, that was his main source to get things to sell in Chicago (I understood the underground site lets you buy anonymously and pay anonymously with Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency). But he informed me that the marketplace disappeared, and the owners of the site ran off with 50 million dollars a day ago. He was sad that now he will have to start finding a new source for goods. (He was using someone else's Uber account, a relative he said. And I didn't know that he was not using an account associated with his own name until midway through the ride until I kept calling him the wrong name and he corrected me).

Can you people really shuffle food these days? I thought I could with this one after making 2 futile attempts in calling the customer. It was a $50 order from a pizzeria that could translate to my dinner that night and also feeding me the following day. What is the logic of the 5-minute timer if drivers cannot keep the food? Not advocating for shuffling here but don't we deserve to be compensated for the waiting time?

As what you would expect from Lyft, Postmate also loves to sneak in an ""offer"" without notifying us. At first, I thought it was not a big deal because the drop off location was added along the route. Not until I slided the ""complete pick up"" button, it was too late to realize the possibility of scam due to the red flags of ""teen"" and his message ""I don't want my parents to know"".




Days after the failure to shuffle the pizza and Lasagna bolognese, the customer tipped me decently.




To my surprise, that underage customer also tipped me 2 weeks after the delivery. I am certain that he did tip because the $10 tip from the first delivery showed up the same evening. However, I still do not have any faith in the younger generations. Keeping the photo I took at his front door and also a selfie video showing I walked back to my car empty will become extremely useful should one day his boredom provokes him to do something dirty.

post-6495782,Wildgoose,"Sep 4, 2020 at 1:16 PM","It has been almost a year now. One evening around 4:00 pm, I got a ping with a male's name. I drove to the pick up point and wait a couple minutes and I saw a teen couple coming out. When they reached to my car, the boy opened the door for this girl. She got in and sat, then they were exchanging a few words. I realized that the account owner requested Uber for the girl and it was 30 mins ride. After they said see you later, I drove off and trying make a U turn, as we were going to Oakland West Bart station. After 400 feet from pick up point, I noticed that this girl started crying silently. I was being silent and waited for a few minutes but she didn't stop her silent crying. then I asked ""Is there something wrong, Honey?"" Then she started crying out.

As we were heading to Oakland, she told me her story. She is 18 and just gave a birth with that boy. She had no job. Her mother kicked her out of her house but kept the baby. She had asked help from police but they delivered her to a hospital. That day she was discharged from hospital and tried reach to her boyfriend, father of her baby. That boy was living with her mom and still in school, had part time job. Her boyfriend also didn't accept her to give temporary shelter as well. She had been her boyfriend's house since morning and seemed he tried to kick her out before his mom came back from work. So she was going to Bart station and hoping to get connected her friends.

It was a really sad story of her. I was trying to encourage her to call her mom and beg. I tried several times to call her mom. She refused and cried, cried. She told me I don't know her mom but I know how a parent would be worrying about their run away kid. She didn't give me her mother's contact number so I have no choice but to send her to her destination. As it was getting dark and because of her weak plan, I asked her if she had done her dinner. She said No. I asked if she was hungry and she said she was starving. That bastard of her boyfriend, didn't even offer her a meal the whole day. So I decided to buy her dinner so she won't be hungry the whole night. I told her that I would buy her something to eat but we had to finished the ride first at destination. And told her to let her boyfriend know. She said her phone was not in service, and she would only have wifi to connect when she got free wifi spot. Alright then, let it be.

As I finished the ride, I asked her what she would like to eat. Chinese, Pizza, Burger, whatever, I would want to fill up your stomach full for the night so she wouldn't be hungry before she found help. This poor girl just choose McDonald's burger. I felt sad. She didn't want to use my money too much. As per her choice, I drove to McDonald's and let her order her burger at drive through. She did order just one burger. I told her it won't be enough and should order more burger. She refused my offer. Then I told clerk to add meal with the burger and make it two burger. And I drove her off at her destination Oakland Bart station Again. She would enjoy her food there.

At the drop off, as she got out, I got out off the car as well. I wanted to give her a good luck hug but I didn't. I didn't want to make physical contact to my ex-pax because of R/S policy. So I could just wish her good luck and gave her Obama's famous word for strength "" You can do it.""

I hope she is doing well right now. She will never forget about an Asian guy was trying to help her.
As I left, I cursed her boyfriend really bad. Because of him, she was pregnant and gave birth. Because of that she was kicked out from her house. That M.F didn't try to give her shelter or didn't try to help her out with some money. The worst was he didn't even offer her a meal the whole day and for night. Men who don't have responsible manner are really disgusting.",2020

post-6680129,Benjamin M,"Dec 13, 2020 at 9:48 PM","A few weeks ago, I had an incident after I accepted an Uber X trip that turned out to be actually transporting a contaminated inflatable hospital bed from one nursing home to another.

I was promised a tip in exchange for this, it was pretty clear that I was shafted. I was pissed so I followed up, apparently my email correspondence ended up going to the account holder and he (unsuccessfully) attempted to get me deactivated.

That thread is here - Thread 'Transported an ""air mattress"" and ""I will tip you in the app""' 

That situation, along with horrible pings for pax and non tipping on delivery, made me decide to -

Thread 'Working on my exit' 

In between online programming courses, I came across these videos on YouTube.




So, she was doing Doordash for two whole weeks. A customer pulled a scam (what a surprise) and, instead of calling Doordash, she decided that the best idea was to return to the customer and confront her while recording on her phone.

She then doxed the customer (I did not) to the point that the pharmacy had to disable reviews on Google. And, in the first linked video, there is a link to send her money.

Key lessons -

1. If you are doing deliveries, regardless of the platform, call support immediately if you are accused of not delivering the order. A friend of mine recently had this happen, I encouraged him to call Uber and he did. But he decided to quit, after being threatened with deactivation.

2. If you are pissed off, let it go - especially if your first idea is to point your phone in the customer's face and put it on YouTube. Yes, I posted a video here ages ago of a bad pax. It was not a public video, I blurred his face, and I later deleted it. Bad idea all around.

3. Doordash sucks, they can keep their stupid Red Card and buggy app - that's just my opinion &#128514;",2020
post-6647388,O-Side Uber,"Nov 24, 2020 at 1:18 PM","I had just picked-up a delivery order from an outdoor shopping mall and was leaving the place when this incident took place. I had pulled out of the shopping center and came up on a streetlight with a crosswalk. The light was turning orange so I slowed to stop for it. 

As I was coming to a stop, this woman appeared in the crosswalk and I had to give the brakes a somewhat hard stop because I didn’t want to risk coming too close to her in the crosswalk. She had not even turned her head to look for cars when she stepped into the street . She seemingly appeared out of no where. 

I stopped in time so It should not of been an issue , but this woman was clearly enraged that I had to hard stop 3 feet before the crosswalk. 

She appeared to be in her mid 30’s, dressed in scrubs , big face diaper on carrying some shopping bags from the various upscale stores there. She turned to me and gave this crazed look. 

At this point I pointed to my eyes and then started to mime like I was walking in place . Basically I was trying to say look for cars when your walking...I did this more in a comical way because I already felt she was over reacting . 

That’s when the events turned nuts. She stormed up to my car window . Now try to imagine a horror movie where the maniac is suddenly staring at you inches from your face , eyes bugging out like a crazy person . That damn mask 😷 in my face. You guys know how I feel about the masks! 

I calmly roll my window down and turn my head to her. She is still bugging like she’s going to punch me. I calmly told her she should at least turn her head before marching into the street so she doesn’t get hit by a car that doesn’t see her. I thought I was being logical. 

Whelp, she started screaming under her mask that she’s a pedestrian and it’s a crosswalk. I agreed however I stopped 3 feet before it so GET THE F AWAY FROM ME !!!!! I yelled back. That’s when things became violent . 

She became UNHINGED and started high stepping my car door , repeatedly kicking it . This is my new car I owe $18k on btw. I threw my car in park , fumbled with the door lock , finally got the door open before about the 3rd kick to my door. She was mid-kick when I opened it , so she fell back on the street . 

I was close to losing my temper but I was well aware that she was a woman and I don’t punch, kick , slap or stomp women. However, I will protect myself and my property the best I can bring a civilian with no training on how to do so . 

I was furious at her for putting me in this situation and damaging my car. I bent down and ripped her shopping bags from her hands . My thought was I’ll throw these as far as I can into the street as payback and hopefully she’ll go chase them and I can escape. We’ll that’s not how it went. 

Firstly , small bags of clothes don’t throw very far. It was like trying to throw a feather. The bags only landed like 8 feet away . As I turned to jump into my car and split, she jumps up and tries to get in my car before I do. 

She was almost all the way in my driver side as a grabbed her by the back of her head and peeled out off my my car and just kind of threw her away from the car. 

Now she is playing the victim and started screaming for help . I’m just trying to get away at this point. I was just about to shut my driver door when like the Terminator she jumps back up dives into my driver side window , which is still rolled down from earlier . I’m now in a horror movie. Night if the Living Covidiot. That’s the only way I can describe it. 

She knocked my side view mirror backwards and is now clinging on to my door bending it down . I was wondering why my car wasn’t moving only revving in place .. the emergency brake was on . I calmly told her .. let go of my car, let go of my car , let go of my car.she screams No!! I then popped the e-break and punched it. She flew off , I bailed . What the F just happened???? Holy shit!!! I looked in my rear view and there were like 3 cars behind me. I’m assuming jail is coming for me. 

I called my girlfriend and told her what happened . I got her phone number and wrote it on my arm . No one remembers phone numbers anymore . Now the funny part is , I actually delivered the $4 order I picked up so I wouldn’t lose access to the app. 🤡 I then headed toward home when a local number called me , I answered. 

Who is it? THE POLICE DEPARTMENT!!! 👮‍♀️ 
My life is over.....or is it????

He says “Hi Oside Uber! Do you mind coming back to the scene where the women attacked you? We have her here in the police car 🚔.” I was very calm and compliant . I let him know I was 10 minutes away and headed back over there. 

I show up and there’s like 6 cop suburbans, K-9’s. About 10 cops standing around . No ambulances luckily. He checked the damage to my car and got my statement . They seemed to be holding back laughter over it all. He assured me no one was in trouble. I told him I didn’t intend to press charges. He kind of laughed and said he didn’t think I would . I consider myself lucky she didn’t get hurt . 

I’m sure the Dudley Do-Rights on here will rip me a new one for getting into an altercation with a female , but you never expect these incidents when they happen . 

Everyone is stressed out. My car door has a nice dent in the bottom of it but I was able to bend the door back up so I closes properly . Go ahead, tell me how YOU would’ve handled my situation .",2020

post-6618906,Reynob Moore,"Nov 8, 2020 at 2:41 AM","This just happened about 30 minutes ago.

I have done well over 7k rides total on lyft and uber combined. I am cool with almost all my passengers. They always thank me, we usually have a nice conversation, and exchange pleasantries. Let me explain what just happened.

I was on my way home after doing about 30 trips today and grossing about 385. I put lyft on destination mode and figured Id do one more pickup. It was a young looking female with a rating of 4.8. 4.8 I thought? Thats pretty low, I wonder why. About halfway there she texts on the app asking me ""Can I confirm pickup""? which was odd. I figured this must be the reason shes rated low, as unnecessary texting is no doubt not only annoying to me but others as well. Nonetheless, I responded saying Im on the way. To which she responded thanks the app is acting weird.

I arrive and wait about 2 minutes and she comes out. She mispronounces my name then apologizes and says ""Max will be right out"". I said ""Max, oh ok. I love how you act like I know him"". Half annoyed at the fact that she mispronounced my name and half being a smart ass.

So she starts yelling at max to come out and I say Ill give him one more minute. She keeps yelling for him and finally he comes out. Dude gets in and says ""Hey buddy"". To which I really didnt want to respond but I wasnt trying to be too much of a dick so I gave him a disinterested ""Whats goin on"".

A minute or two later she starts saying she put in 2 stops, one of them a taco bell drive thru. I told them we dont do drive thrus. She says ""Are you not ******, referring to my name. Now im starting to get pissed as she damn well knows my name and is acting as if someone is my boss or overseer. She persists about the taco bell drive thru even after I said I suppose I can make an exception and really pissed me off. So I pulled over and said ""You know what you guys can get out right here"".

The dude says ""Are you serious""? I say yes. He then says ""Youre a piece of shit"". I said ""excuse me""? He said ""You heard me"".

At this point I went from 0 to 60 in about half a second. ""Get out of the car right now"" I said. I get out and slam the driver door. About 30 seconds or so later they both emerge. I can see he is drunk. He puts his hands up and says ""Im not gonna fight you"". I can see he is legit scared so I said ""Im not gonna fight you but this is ridiculous"". The dumbass girl is still pointing to the app and saying ""Arent you ******"" blah blah referring to my name as if Ive been appointed to be her servant or something. So there they are standing on the curb on the side of a road a couple miles from where I picked them up and I get in my car and drive off.

It was really cold tonight. Let that be a lesson to these entitled drunk idiots.

That being said, how would you have handled the situation? Would you have gotten angry and kicked them out for acting the way they did? Or do you think I overreacted? When the guy called me a piece of shit for telling them to get out honestly I was ready to beat some ass. Im glad the dude backed down or that could have been really bad.",2020

I pick up this guy in Wheaton, Illinois and he’s totally wasted and he’s going to this party and he’s trying to get me to go with him and I kept telling him that I couldn’t go I had to work so he starts calling me a p***y and if you’re a guy you know how that feels so I put aside my pride and I kept telling him no. So, now he gets on the phone and he calls the girl who’s throwing this party and he puts her on speaker and he starts telling her to convince me into going and shes like don’t be a sissy and come over I’ll introduce you to a bunch of my girlfriends so ok two problems here, one she said dont be a sissy and then she says I’ll meet a lot of girls so guys you know how we are in situations like this so she finally gets me to commit and now I’m stuck.
We were now about five minutes away and I’m trying to think if there’s any possible way of getting out of this and by the time I pulled in the driveway I couldn’t come up with one reason so here I am being dragged into this party by a guy who I just met and whose acting like I’m some kind of big fish he caught in the lake and this is one of those times you wish you had a time machine.
Now, as I’m walking in with this guy it finally hits me “COVID”! I forgot about that and this place is packed with Latino gang members who not even one person at all is wearing a mask or doing any kind of social distancing so without even thinking I said oh wait, I forgot my mask in the car and then I got this who farted look from everyone in the room so I guess I’m not getting my mask so this is where the trouble comes.
Well, first off all, the girls I was supposed to meet all had boyfriends and the three who didn’t looked like tow trucks so now I realize that I’m not getting any action but here’s the worst part, my drunk passenger is introducing me to every single person in this party like Im some rock star, well that’s what I thought at first and then I realized that he was saying here’s my Uber driver Ha Ha Ha and they were all cracking up laughing at me and in the meantime I must have had thirty people spitting all over me on top of shaking hands and getting hugged so now I’m screwed!

post-6578133,Fusion_LUser,"Oct 19, 2020 at 1:45 PM","I didn't drive on Saturday night because I wined and dined my wife (Olive Garden To Go so we could watch The Walking Dead at home) so I did go out on drive on Sunday... lately it's been busy enough to turn my back on religious fulfillment and sell my soul to the Uber Devil.

Anyway I get a ping at 4.1x for a 4 mile ride that will be about 15 minutes. The pax had a 4.6* rating and it's at a local restaurant that is pricey so I figure this will be another smooth ride.

I get to the restaurant and did the usual text ""I have arrived.""

The pax responds, ""Are you my Uber driver?""

(Really?)

Me: Yes
Pax: Are you out front?
Me: Yes I have arrived.
Pax: I'm on my way out, meet me at the front please so I know its you.

It was almost 3 minutes that passed and I get that feeling I may cancel this ride when a 40ish white lady comes out and stares at me and my car and her phone for almost 30 seconds! She slowly approaches the car and I roll down the passenger window and ask ""Are you Maria?"" She nods yes and again looks at her phone then at me as I unlocked the doors...

Maria opens the rear passenger door...

Maria: Are you my Uber driver?
Me: Yes.
Maria: You are Fusion_LUser?
Me: Yes.
Maria: Do you have ID to show?

(OK I was not expecting that question at all and I was stumped on what to say, I was thinking did this lady really just ask me for ID???)

Maria: I need to see your ID!
Me: We don't show ID, Uber has my picture car and license plate for you to verify I am your driver.
Maria: But you are wearing a mask! How do I know its really you?
Me: We are not required to show our ID miss.
Maria: I need to see your ID to verify you are who you say you are.
Me: Miss I'm not giving you my ID if you like you can cancel the ride.
Maria: I should not have to cancel the ride when you are not complying with the law by identifying yourself.

(This ride is over I just need her to shut my door. I was going to cancel by saying the pax was a no-show but I just decided to cancel the ride...)

Me: Miss I'm not going to hand you my wallet or ID. If you want to see my ID you can come to my window and look at my ID with my window closed.

(Maria lifts her head out of my car and before she heads to my side I channel my father and say ""Close the door you are letting all the cold air out!"" and she closes the door.

<Doors locked> <Ride cancelled>

When she gets behind my car I slowly pull away. I contemplated letting her come up to my window so I tell her she is a complete nut job but I just decided to keep my mouth shut and move on.

I have yet to see anyone mention they had to show ID to a pax. Has anyone ever had one ask for ID? She didn't say what kind of ID so maybe she thinks rideshare drivers need ID like taxi drivers?",2020

I'm assuming it was only because I was the only driver in queue? I was getting calls for pickups around the airport also which I declined and all were standard fare price, not surging.

Once there, I saw the garage door open, and there was a lady at the back of the garage by the door in a wheelchair. She called out that she needed help so I went to her and pushed her down the driveway to my car. I opened the door and she told me she had cerebral palsy and would need help. I gave her my hand but she said she really could not move her body well. So she said she would need to put her arms around my neck and that I would have to carry her. I was fine with this but since she was around the same body weight as mine, it took some time. The only issue I had was that as I positioned her in my back seat, she sort of fell sideways and slightly hit her head on the opposite door (not hard) before I could put her seat belt on. I put the wheelchair in as best I could... I drove her to church which was four blocks away. I wheeled her into the church and sat her down and positioned her carefully as Mass was starting. She had no complaints and was happy but I was afraid she could have been injured while I was placing her into my car. Has anyone been in a similar situation?",2020
post-6678628,Erik M,"Dec 12, 2020 at 10:00 PM","I picked up my Pax from Costa Mesa, CA last Friday night and drove her to work, “The Fritz” stripclub on Katella near Disneyland. After about 5 mins she takes her seatbelt off and says “sorry but I’m really uncomfortable. I just bleached my butthole and now I think I’m having a reaction to it”. She pulls a wet nap from her bag and reaches down the back of her skirt and I’m assuming she starts wiping or scratching with it. I kinda chuckled about it but kept driving and looking forward not wanting to make a big deal out of it. Then after a few mins she starts squirming around again, she does this the whole 15min trip. When we get to the parking lot of the stripclub she says “I know this is strange but I need you to look at my butthole and tell me if there’s a rash”. Apparently if there’s a rash on their genitalia they aren’t allowed to work so she didn’t want to ask her co workers. She bents over my backseat and pulls her underwater to the side and asks me to “please look”! I told her very politely that it was a very ackward situation for me and I didn’t want to be accused of wrong doing by helping her with her problem. She then wipes it again with a wet nap, mutters how uncomfortable it was then grabs her stuff and leaves the car. I immediately email Uber and explain the entire situation and save the dash cam video in case something comes of it. Today I get an email from Uber saying they’ve deactivated her account for violating their sexual harassment policy and asks if I need any kind of cousiling from the incident. It says it’s free of charge if I decide to accept it......Yea right like I need counseling from it! I didn’t mean to get her deactivated, I was just covering my ass. We as Men are always being accused of sexual misconduct and I didn’t want to be a statistic.

But, RS is absolutely not what it was before. Tips are unimaginable, false allegations are up, and we're at risk of yet another potential harm to our health and well-being - while rates have been reduced in many markets.

I have been off the road for about two weeks (by choice), spending my time catching up on programming (many years of experience, needed a break) and waiting for some support through PUA.

My enthusiasm for driving has made some even think that I am an employee and not a driver. As much as I wish that were true, I also mourn the loss of Richmond's GLH and the staff there, they were always on my side - now completely gone.

Hoping for success in web dev yet again and I am not putting off the idea of driving again in the future, hopefully as it was intended - a side gig.

After completing one trip, I headed to pick up my next passenger, and about 4 miles into the trip to pick her up, she calls me. So, after cheerfully answering the call, here is how the rest of the conversation went:

My passenger: Hi, I'm your passenger. When will you be here?

Me: Well, all of that information should be in your app.

My passenger: It keeps on telling me different things.

Me: Ok, I'll check for you, just a moment (I'm physically holding the phone and have to toggle to get back to Uber). Ok, looks like I'll be there in 9 minutes. What does your app say?

My passenger: I can't see it because I'm on the phone? Where are you?

Me: I'm 9 minutes away.

My passenger: But where are you?

Me: All I can tell you is that I'm 9 minutes away.

My passenger: You mean you can't tell me where you are?

Me: Hangs up phone and cancels the ride.

Now, I'm a really friendly driver once I pick up passengers, and if a customer needs to call me for legitimate reasons, I have no problem with it, but when they have everything they need to know in their app, and still call me anyway, it just irritates me.

post-6650414,Young Kim,"Nov 26, 2020 at 8:27 AM","While driving around pax these days, I discuss subjects (if they are interested) like the weather, the pandemic, Uber, stocks, physics, sports, and magic. Yesterday I discussed with a pax about autonomous cars and she said she would never get into an autonomous Uber or autonomous Tesla. She told me that she could never feel safe not being able to yell or correct a driver. We then discussed the bizarre toppy stock market. After breaking 30,000 on the DOW, we just reflected that by any measure the U.S. stock market is trading at valuations which I find troubling.

We discussed Uber's stock price which I follow and its lows a few months ago at the middle of the pandemic was 13.71. A couple of days ago it traded to 52.00. I understand the successful court victory in California... but after announcing more losses in their latest earnings report, I am amazed at our mothership's stock ascent.

As I drive around and do deliveries these days, business is not something that I would imagine could propel the Death Star's stock so high... UberX is rather slow, and UberEats is replete with $2.50 offers. Surge has almost gone non-existent. This tells me that business must not be good for Uber. But the Mothership's stock races at all time highs? I also understand that a vaccine is upcoming, so that is promising...

I dunno, but methinks that a near term top in Uber's stock is in short order... If business is in the toilet and the stock is at all time highs, with a grey zone towards profitability, I am looking for an imminent attack on the Death Star's stock price.",2020

I show them nice white teeth and law abiding face. Harvard study said black people are more likely to get shot in police stops so I always smile at them and greet them well.

Funny thing is I knew he was behind me for a while as I saw a red IR or laser dot in his windshield in his full black car and he mentioned I touched center lane but I didn't cross it. He said he saw me interacting with my phone and I informed him it is mandatory for my Uber job ri interact with it occasionally but it's on dashboard magnet mount.

I was waiting for my passenger Sarah and her Husband, they ended up tipping me $8 after I told them a skinny dude got into my car and I kindly told him I'm waiting for Sarah and he called me N word. He got into my car from a Cowboy Jacks bar in downtown Minneapolis. His racism came out when he got pissed that I wouldn't be able to take him. That time MPD would've booked me in had I induced Coma on him, but luckily for him I have self control. I weight about near 100 pounds more than he did
 . That image of me is before adrenaline rush and muscles enlargement in a fight, imagine how I would look fighting him. I'd be 2 times bigger looking than that image with muscles in fight or flight situation.
I was able to come close to guessing his weight by exactly how skinny and shorter than me he looked. Taller skinny guys can weigh more, but this dude didn't have any friends for backup and right in front of the bar he decided to call me N word. Can you guys believe in America there are white guys calling black people and especially black workers in Uber transport like myself the N-Word? I have never been called it and I have lived in the US since 1991 but he was first to actually call me this. He wanted a black man to drive him, but he was racist himself the whole time",2020

post-6474152,PioneerXi,"Aug 25, 2020 at 2:00 AM","I drive a black Chevrolet Equinox. It has plates issued by the California DMV on the front and rear, and those plates are not issued to any other vehicle. The vehicle is fitted with an Uber and Lyft sticker on the front and rear windows.




I am a caucasian male, 6 foot tall, short brown hair, and a mustache. When you order an Uber, my photo comes up in the app. It's a good photo of me too.

I'm also married. My Wife is short, 5 foot tall (in heels), shoulder length natural red/burgundy hair, and has a spectacular chest.

She does not have a mustache.

When the Covid pandemic started, I drove my last passenger on 11 March 2020, as I have the care of a parent susceptible with underlying health conditions. Nothing since.

The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is one of the largest hospitals in the county. It has an ER, trauma ward, and an separate outpatient entry that you can drive up to and drop someone off.




Or pick them up.

On the morning of Monday 24 August 2020, the Wife took my vehicle to work, as She had to pick up a friend of the family, a patient of the hospital, at the end of the day. A patient losing to cancer.

The Wife turns into the hospital grounds and pulls up in the loading zone in front of Out Patients. She puts the vehicle in park and before She can turn the engine off, the back door opens.

""Hi, I'm Jake.""

Wife turns around and looks Jake in the eye and says ""You've got the wrong car, Jake.""

Jake looks down at his phone and then back at my Wife.

""Can't you take me anyway, you're an Uber.""

Wife calmly explains that She is not an Uber driver, and asks Jake to exits the car. Jake steps out ...and before he can close the door, a woman holds the door open and asks ""Are you my Uber?""

Wife explains that She is not an Uber, and gets some opposition back from the female.

""If you're not here for me, then why are you here with the Uber signs?""

Wife, recognizing the ""entitled millennium"" attitude prevalent in so many people says ""I'm not your Uber,"" and calmly presses the door lock as the woman closes the rear door.

Wife pulls out her cell phone to text the patient that She is present outside the doors, and that She is in my vehicle with extra leg room...and room for their wheelchair.

As She is texting, a second guy (now the third person) comes up to the front passenger door and tries to open the (locked) door. The passenger swings their cell phone around to show Wife the passenger app, and even sitting across the vehicle, She can see that the passengers driver is still three minutes away...in their silver Prius.

""Look at your app, you've got the wrong car,"" she yells at him without unlocking the doors. The male person turns the cell phone back to themselves, sees the error of their ways, and backs away gesturing an apology.

After texting the patient, Wife reports She sat for about ten minutes waiting for a response. The Patients chemotherapy was wearing Him down so we knew that schedules had to be flexible. During that time Wife had two more people wandering about, heads down looking at their cell phone in the palm of their hand. She watched as they went back and forth before approaching the vehicle and attempting to enter the rear door. Neither of them walked to the driver side to approach my Wife.

With time to spare waiting for the patients, She presses the on board link to telephone me.

""I'm never driving your car again.""

Quickly I run through the back of mind about my car. Oil change not due. AC recharged two weeks ago. Sirius XM reprogrammed so Her favorite station is on the first list of favorites.

""Is there something wrong?"" I ask.

""Yeah. Everyone coming out of the hospital thinks I'm their Uber.""

I look at the clock - it 5pm. Both outpatients and business day employees are leaving. I laugh and explain to her that every passenger has at least seven different pieces of information to identify their Uber, including the license plate and the driver photo.

She asks ""Then why do they keep coming up to me?""

""Passengers are morons,"" I deliver previously unknown information. ""There was a young girl who failed to check her Uber's ID before getting in, and unfortunately lost her life.""

She questions the intelligence of the Human Race by asking ""Are people really that stupid?""

""People are morons,"" I respond, not missing a beat.

Wife reports on the earlier passengers. At this location, there I is a dedicated Uber/Lyft zone outside this hospital entrance and I ask if She's parked in it. She reports that She's not in the zone, but can see that it is about three vehicle spaces in front of her, where a white Honda Accord is parked.

""So, you're parked between the hospital doors and the Uber zone, near the Vallet podium?"" I ask.

""How did you know that,"" She inquires.

I'd been there enough on both pick up and drop offs that I said the valet should be getting ready to go home at 5:15pm.

""He just walked off now,"" She informed me.

I tell her that the app has dedicated locations to pick up passengers, and that that location where She is parked, is where the app tells passengers their Uber is. It's not where the actual pick up location is.

""It's thirty feet. Are you telling me that people won't walk thirty feet to get into the correct Uber?""

""People are morons,"" I tell her again. ""They're so wrapped up in themselves and oblivious to the outside world that they fail to assess the potential threats around them. They will get into a car, any car, thinking that it's their Uber, because they don't consider that an Uber could be for anyone but them. And if they're really entitled, when they realize their error, they'll respond aggressively - as though it's your fault.""

I hear the sound of my Wife unlocking the doors of the car, followed by the sound of a door opening. I hear a voice, an voice unknown to me.

""Hi there. Downtown to 5th Avenue please. Take the 5, it's quicker.""

Another passenger has entered and is giving directions. I already know this is going to go bad.

My Wife turns back to continue our telephone discussion and says ""What's Uberspeak for Get The #### Out Of My Car?""

I paused, confused until She says ""Another moron just got into the car.""

""Hey,"" the unknown voice responds. ""You can't speak to me like that, I'll one star you.""

The thing about red heads having a fiery temper- all true. My Wife has the sweetest smile I've ever seen, but it hides a savage mouth. I heard profanity, raised voices and at least one threat to tear lungs out, before the door closed and the vehicle was quiet for a moment.

""####, people really are morons,"" She said exasperated. ""How do you do it?""

""Not like that,"" I said.

She continues to report on the last passenger.

""WTF? The guy just got into the white Accord and has left. Your car looks nothing like an Accord.""

I can't take it further before the hospital staff arrive, our friend in the wheelchair. I stay on the phone as I listen to them load him in the car. He sounds...bad. The Wife gets back in the car and starts it.

""I have the correct passenger,"" She announces, and I can hear the calmness back in her voice. We hang up.

When She eventually arrives home, I'm still trying to scheme how I can turn Her next hospital run into cancellation fees.",2020

post-6451722,Young Kim,"Aug 16, 2020 at 6:37 AM","I just finished my long Saturday night shift and wished to share how every time I see 3:36 am cross my phone screen on a Saturday night I get chills. A couple of years ago in August, I had my most memorable (painful Saturday night) Ubering. At 3:36 am, I was picking up a passenger off the 94 and Fullerton in Chicago, and got a call from a good friend, ""V"". In a panicked voice, she said ""S"" took too much heroin and was passed out (""V"" and ""S"" were dating and living together). They had a one year old baby at the apartment. She asked me to stop working and drive up to Lake Bluff, IL to help her. I told her ,""NO! Call 911!!"" She refused because she was also taking heroin and didn't want the police involved. I explained to her that I am in the city, working Uber, and the drive was 40 minutes north, and she should call the police and ambulance.

She again refused (I didn't actually know their apartment address, so I demanded that she call). She countered with ""PLEASE DON'T, I THINK THAT ""S"" is fine, but he has fallen asleep and I need you to come her and help me take care of him!"" and told me that she thought that ""S"" had just fallen asleep and is now OK. I told her to put the phone by his mouth so I could hear his breathing. He seemed to be breathing fine. I asked her to see if he had a pulse, and she said the pulse was normal. I cancelled my pickup and logged off. And started to drive to Lake Bluff.

After I got there, I entered the apartment... she opened the door and ""S"" was sitting up on the floor leaning against the couch. I thought he was fine, I could hear him breathing quietly. So I walked up to him and said, ""Hey bro, wake up! I'm here now to take care of you"". As I touched his skin, it was cold and clammy. I opened his eyes... and that is when I felt a chill go up my spine that cemented that moment as the . His ... I immediately yelled at her to call 911! And she did. I proceeded to give him CPR, while he kept vomiting in my mouth. I finally stopped once the police and ambulance arrived, and they took over. ""S"" had overdosed, and was dying.

They had found a pulse, stabilized him, and then left. I stayed and left a statement. ""S"" died three days later after being in a coma, but the hospital said I kept him alive long enough for them to stabilize him and give the family hope (his organs were donated). Both ""S"" and ""V"" were my good friends. Years ago, I met them through a mutual friend. I personally never had done dope, never will, and grimace even more whenever I hear of anyone abusing drugs. (One thing I realized that when she had sat him up on the couch thinking this positioning would help him, it actually ended up making him choke on his own vomit. She was supposed to lay him on his left side). ""V"" was not arrested but she had her child taken away and went to a group home. That night of doing Uber... that Saturday night. Now, on a Saturday night...whenever I see 3:36 am pass on my app... I get a chill... and pain that never goes away.

(screenshot tonight at 3:36 am... I always mentally freeze every Saturday night, at 3:36 am).

post-6323473,El Janitor,"Jun 21, 2020 at 10:44 PM","I haven't been driving UBER as much. Right now I can't because someone I live with could die if they get COVID-19 so no passengers for awhile. I have been doing some Eats, but thankfully I was able to get another job so I don't have to rely solely on UBER. I also want to say, I am not above driving for a living, but at times I'm happy I don't have to do it so much.

Some drivers solely rely on driving for a living, I know it can be stressful, I've done it myself. There's good days and bad days, and then there's bad passengers. I remember getting in my car, and one guy hadn't showered in a few days, I was happy when I dropped him off. I had one passenger get crazy over differences in the way we lived our lives, I was happy when I dropped him off. I've had people vape in my car without asking, and then try to play stupid when I said something to them about it nicely. I've had a few passengers who worried me a little and was also happy when I dropped them off. However for the most part the majority of my passengers have been normal people who go from A to B, and to be honest the're the best customers. Pick up, drop off no issues, they respect me and my car and we're done. Love to have you again anytime.

However there's the bad passengers. It's a whole spectrum of people who for whatever reason can't drive and need a ride somewhere but they just can't get in sit quietly and be dropped off. I've read the stories on this site and I can relate to a few of them. Some passengers do drive, but for whatever reason they need a ride somewhere, but they just can't seem to be respectful to the driver. They need to let you know that they are superior to you, and try to make you feel small. Or they think you're stupid, or whatever is going on in their head and they just can't accept the fact they they need you to take them somewhere, and be happy you are there to do that.

I'm a car guy, I love cars always have. I used to enjoy fixing mt car etc etc etc. To this day I enjoy my car. If you're going to get into my car respect it. I keep it clean, and I keep it up and I'm sharing it with you. I don't smoke so don't smoke in my car. Don't vape, don't do drugs, and please eat before you request a ride or after I drop you off. I've seen the complaints from passengers and I know that some drivers have dirty cars, etc etc and aren't the nicest people. However some of the passenger stories are just entitled garbage. Drivers put high miles on their cars and make little pay. Some drivers have educations and job skills that the passengers have no clue about. Some of them are doing this so their family won't get evicted etc.. Not everyone has a smooth life, think before you speak.

So in conclusion and I stand by this if you don't like UBER, Lyft, if your Rolls Royce Limo broke down and you are just disgusted at the fact that you need to call an UBER, be thankful you aren't on the bus.I'm happy to drop you at a bus stop and you can GTFO. I'm sure someone on the bus will want to spark up an interesting conversation with you. Hopefully it's about how the aliens in frying pans took their dog, and raped the ducks and you're one of them and there on to you because they know you come from quack quack! Seriously enjoy that. There's so many fun things about the bus, but if you don't like the bus there's always cabs. Cabs charge double or triple what your UBER ride would be, and well you can roll the dice to see how well maintained the cab is.

For whatever reason a passenger needs a ride they need to be respectful of the driver and their vehicle. It should be mutual, and if at the very least all you need to do is confirm who you are and where you are going, and ask the driver if they are who it says on your app. You can sit quietly and enjoy the scenery as it goes by, and wait till you get to your destination. It's just that simple, if you like the service you can leave a tip, we like tips, if we made you happy. Rideshare is so much nicer then the bus, all you have to do is be nice and respectful.",2020

I got the ping and arrived within 3 minutes, I noticed for some reason I was being given the death stare by the pax, so the pax gets in I greet the pax, confirm name and destination and I set off.

I drive straight on and I come to a stop at a set of traffic lights, the lights turn green and I drive on and there are two trucks in the left lane in front of me at the next set of lights, lights turn green I indicate to overtake them in the right lane and then promptly move back into the left lane, so I come to a standstill at the next set of lights and anticipating to move into the right lane, I switch the indicator on....and *poke-slap* from behind my pax startles me! I turn around with shock as to wtf just happened!?

I ask the pax why did you do that? and I get cut off with ""Why did you *##*### bring me this way"" and ""You're getting me late for work"", bare in mind the pax has only been in my car for just over 2 minutes, I take deep breaths and tell the pax I'm cancelling the ride. I pull up outside a bar the pax starts raising their voice & shouting and I tell the pax to get out of my car. I'm still in shock as to why the pax thought they could assault me.

Today Uber died - drowned in a sea of ants almost from the getgo, I gave just 4 rides totaling $32 between 0445 and 0830 - miserable results. I wasn't being real choosy, either - normally I get kicked off Uber 3-4 times per morning for hat trick declines, but not at all today. I don't know who kicked the ant hill, but they were both early and everywhere.

At any rate, starved but not ready to throw in the towel, I opened Lyft...surprise - I made more with Lyft during the normally dead 9-11 AM than I made with Uber all morning.

However, during the past 3 weeks, I've given out just one mask (provided by Uber) to a rider who didn't have one but was happy to wear one.

post-5966086,Benjamin M,"Mar 9, 2020 at 7:39 PM","Second time that I have taken a ""service animal"", some lap dog that clearly has no training or indication at all of performing a service.

Pulled up to the address, they waved me into the driveway. Pax was in a foldable motorized wheelchair.

Hopped out to load it (unsure at first if it would even fit) and all of the sudden two dogs are walking around me. A fluffy lap dog of some sort and a pit mix - whatever, they were chill. Nobody really spoke English. Airport trip.

As I am loading the chair into the trunk, I notice that my front passenger door is open and the small dog is standing on the seat.

""Umm.. Is the dog going with us?""

""Oh, yes, yes. Service dog!"" Riiiiiight. I bite my tongue but ask that they please make him stop climbing on the seat back and such. Then ""oh sorry, he training"". So, which is it?

The dog barely followed simple commands, let alone advanced training to be a service animal, was not on a leash (none visible), and did not have a vest or anything indicating it was a service animal.

Then I ask the pax to sit in the back seat and put the dog on the floor. Had to repeat that several times. Finally, ""oh, no. He more comfortable there"". Fine, whatever.

The pax managed to keep the dog between his legs on the floor during the trip, I said absolutely nothing apart from asking what airline he was flying.

Dropped him off, pulled out his heavy chair without assistance, assembled it, slid his bag in its compartment as requested, and wished him a great day. Rated 5*.

post-6652852,Benjamin M,"Nov 27, 2020 at 7:47 PM","It has been brutally slow here lately. My first hour out, I made $10. Things were getting better around 4pm but I had about had it for the day.

Accepted a ping, and it was an odd one. I was asked to transport an ""air mattress"" (which was actually an inflatable hospital mattress from a nursing home) rather than a pax with a promise of a ""big tip"" - trip was about 35 minutes.

The rest is outlined below in an email. ""I'll tip you in the app"" lie for this? Shame on me for believing that and taking this trip, although it was actually the most profitable of the day.

Elazar has some explaining to do.

Good evening,

At 1539 I accepted a trip request on the Uber platform. Immediately after, I received a message that I would be transporting an ""air mattress"" rather than a passenger, sent by a gentleman named Elazar at the <redactated> location.

Not knowing that I was to transport more than a typical ""air mattress"" but rather a large inflatable hospital mattress from a nursing facility, I agreed.

I hesitated to complete the trip but trips were scarce due to low demand and Elazar promised a ""big tip"". And, upon dropping off the mattress (taken from my trunk by staff wearing PPE), he reiterated that he would tip me - and in fact said he was doing so at that very moment.

As I returned to the city, it became clear that I was not tipped, rather was lied to in order to accept transportation of a possibly hazardous piece of medical equipment - something that is absolutely not part of the Uber platform in Richmond (or delivering anything other than food).

I called the <redacted> facility and they were apologetic and offered me a cash tip of $10 but by that point it was not worth the time, miles, tolls, or effort - Elazar was the account holder and should be responsible. I also called <redacted> and left a message.

Ironically, during ten years of service as a Paramedic, I transported patients to and from both facilities. And I expected better.

UberX is not a delivery service, period. To then blatantly lie about compensation for such a request is reprehensible.

I hope that Elazar remains true to his word (perhaps inform him that drivers know if we have been tipped or not) and that neither facility utilizes rideshare platforms in this manner ever again.

I would appreciate to hear from management, my phone number is <redacted>, best time to reach me is after noon.

Attached are details of the trip (including trip summary with no tip and mention of the air mattress - tipping was mentioned on the phone), audio and video recording is also available.

I stop and he proceeds to tell me ""l just killed big ol 8 point buck abount 100 yards deep into the those there woods. I'm gonna need you to take me with the deer to my pickup truck about 1 mile down the road after l drag that sucker outta the woods.""

""Ok, l will be waiting."" I said. he tells me he will be back soon. Moonshiner proceeds to walk into the woods to retrieve his deer. After he is out of sight, I cancel and high tail it out of there.

No way is anybody putting a stinky bloody dead deer in my car for these cheap rates. Gimme a break.",2020

So I had a pickup at a popular pickup spot and as I pullups to get my pax, there was a drunk dude laying on the ground and his Uber is talking to him. So I go over and ask if the guy is ok. They are cleaning the drunk guys head, and notice that he cracked his head open. 

I don't know what the driver was doing waiting for this idiot. I talked with the uber for a minute to see if he should call an ambulance. 

The Uber TOOK HIM ANYWAY! I shave my head and if I Nick myself it gushes. So I know the drunk dude probably left some blood in the ubers car. 

I know that guy would have had to call someone else, did this site really make me callious to drunk idiots?",2020

I managed to snap a couple of pics but this is not to shame her, I did not take a picture of her face. It was so disgusting I can't believe that much vomit came out of one human being.. she went on for about a minute and a half...

I'm just sharing my story and maybe new drivers could see this can happen at around 3:00 in the morning. By the way she seemed okay when she came in the car with her boyfriend. But 5 minutes until or before the ride ended she suddenly leaned forward and said ""pull over right now!""

post-6337618,goneubering,"Jun 28, 2020 at 2:09 AM","I pulled up to the house in a nice neighborhood and waited a few minutes until a middle aged lady walked very slowly to my car. It took her a minute or two just to sit down and buckle up then she asked me to take her to the hospital. She quickly claimed she wasn’t contagious but she clearly was in a seriously weakened condition. 

I didn’t ask her what was wrong but in my mind I was wondering if she would make it to the hospital alive. When we arrived at the ER I got out and opened her door. I offered to walk her into the hospital but she refused. I stayed in the drop off zone until I saw her safely enter the hospital. Then she dropped down to one knee inside the entrance. A security guard quickly brought her a wheelchair so I left.

This was several months ago before the Covid virus was well known or anyone was wearing masks.

I wonder why she used Uber instead of calling an ambulance? I suppose it was because of the cost. I hope the hospital was able to help her. She said she had been there many times.",2020
post-6514190,Young Kim,"Sep 14, 2020 at 6:41 PM","Had a pax, last ride of the night, pickup around Lincoln Ave and Austin Ave in Morton Grove, IL. Destination was a factory by O'Hare airport. Again, once I develop a solid rapport, I ask gently about their lives (if it seems that they wish to share). She seemed totally normal (affable, funny) and said she takes an Uber often. When I asked if she drives, she replied that she has gotten 6...yes 6...DUIs. But she is still driving! She cannot drive now because of an accident which totaled her car. It was by a bar, and she destroyed her car. The car was her brother's who let her use it (even though she had no driver's license). After the accident, she turned the corner and took off running by foot. She said it did NOT involve another car, so there was nobody around. The next day, the car was impounded and her brother took the blame and notified police. He said the car was totaled, and he had no phone or way to call the towing place, so he walked home. The pax (his sister), said she was drinking, so that is why she fled the accident scene. 

She seemed to be in her mid to late forties, and said she developed a drinking problem as a teenager. And one after another, she got those DUIs. I wished to share this because this is probably the biggest number I had heard of. I have had a couple say that they got two DUIs, and after the 2nd they learned their lesson well. But she said her drinking issue was just so difficult, that the problem spanned decades. And naturally after the 2nd, she started to do some jail time. We both didn't think that a judge would ever let her get her license back. She said that once she gets a new car, she may continue to risk driving, but I advised her not to. Especially with her history, I am worried that if she is caught driving again (since she has no driver's license), it may mean instant jail time. 

I hoped she took my advice. She had no kids or husband... She was quite nice and tipped me $5 in cash at the end, in part because I gave her a light for her cigarette that she desperately wanted to smoke before she started her shift. I remember the end of the ride was funny because I accidentally drove onto a lawn instead of the roundabout where her factory door entrance was, and she laughed so much and remarked that the security guard will likely tease her (and me her Uber driver), for making such a mistake (it was hard to distinguish the grass from the driveway at the time). Anyhow, I was shocked that my pax didn't learn after say the second DUI. I noted to myself that a lot of Uber rides at night are selected from drivers without licenses.",2020

It was in the worst part of Philadelphia that I was delivering and I fear that if I get another report of not wearing a mask I will get fired from Uber like a friend did two years ago for getting reported for drinking three times even though she never drinks. There really needs to be some oversight with these complaints because customers can simply report things that are erroneous and get drivers fired. This isn't fair.

post-6309364,Haanjo,"Jun 15, 2020 at 3:29 PM","Just sent this message to Lyft yesterday, but they didn't respond, and because it has now been more than 24 hours since I sent my message, I don't think they will respond. Having said that, I thought I would share this with the forum, as it will give most Uber / Lyft drivers with a sense of humor a good laugh, as I'm sure you will be able to relate to it....... 

ESCALATION REQUEST

Today I received an email message for Lyft indicating my driver account was flagged and that I could be deactivated due to too many cancellations. I would like to respond to this message and explain some of the reasons why I cancel. I hope that after a Lyft manager has had a chance to review this message, that the flag will be lifted from my account.

First of all I'd like to point out that I have over 2,340 rides with a perfect 5.0 rating. That's a lot of rides, and passengers I give rides to usually give me good ratings.

Usually, if a passenger has a bad experience with me, its because of something they did and not me. Now, I don't know who has complained about me. Perhaps people have complained about me because I cancelled their ride. Let me explain why I do this sometimes:

I would say the number one reason I cancel a ride is because the rider doesn't show up. In most of these cases, I've waited 5 minutes or more for the passenger to show up, even if they send me a message that says, ""I'm coming"" or ""Be right there"". In my experience, usually, when a passenger says, ""I'm coming"" or ""be right there"", what they really mean is that they are not ready and are not coming, and will not arrive until after you have waited 5 minutes. This is a common scenario, where people basically tell you they will be right out, but aren't ready when they say they will be...when they know the clock is ticking down. Is it so unreasonable to cancel their rides after waiting 5 minutes?

There are other reasons I may cancel on a rider after I've waited 5 minutes. For instance, just last week, after I arrived to a passengers pick up location, he called me to let him know that I was at the Kum and Go gas station, so I drove to the Kum and Go to Meet him. Of course, no one was there waiting for me, the 5 minute mark had already passed, I waited for him for an additional 2 minutes, and because I didn't see anyone, I cancelled, but not before driving back to the original pickup point, because Lyft has a policy of not giving me a $5 cancellation fee unless I drive back to the original location, even if I have waited 7 minutes, even when the passenger told me to meet him at a new pickup location...but didn't show up. Is this unreasonable?

Let me tell you another reason I recently cancelled on a passenger. I was on my way to pick up a passenger after accepting a ride. As I was about 5 minutes away, I received a text message from the passenger asking if his LAWN MOWER would fit in my car. Now, I don't know about you, but if you have ever used a lawn mower, they can get very dirty, shed grass everywhere, and smell like gas. Who wants to have someone's lawn mover in their car? Would you? Neither would I, so I cancelled.

Sometimes, I cancel, because someone is covered in puke when I arrive. You know, I drive for Lyft, using my own car. I'm not a health care worker. I don't like my car smelling like vomit. Would you pick up a passenger covered in vomit, or would you cancel? In one instance, I showed up to pick up a passenger, who's friend was vomiting. She was nice enough to have a small plastic container for her passenger to puke in after she got in my car, but have you ever seen someone puke? Its usually a pretty violent action, and people certainly aim their puke in a particular direction, let alone how much of it will come out. Would you pick up that passenger, knowing that they might miss the little plastic containing and puke all over your car, or would you cancel?

I once even had a passenger show up with his passenger, who was a young woman who could barely walk (truthfully, she flopped around like a fish), and he was holding a TRASH BAG as they stumbled along and approached my car. I actually DID pick them up, and miraculously, she didn't puke during the ride. But you know what I should have done? I SHOULD HAVE cancelled as soon as I saw the plastic bag and the woman flopping around like a fish.

But you know what? Not wanting to get puke in my car isn't the only reason I cancel on passengers. I will admit it that even though I try to avoid picking up passengers in neighborhoods where I might get shot, I have still risked my safety to pick up many people in these neighborhoods. But here is what really stinks...

Let's say I'm 20 minutes away from a passenger, who lives in a bad neighborhood, where I might get shot, but just for the heck of it, I decide to drive there anyway to pick up the passenger. Well, in one case, I was on my way to pick up a beautiful girl we will just call Angel. Even though my car might get shot up and that I might die on my way to pick up Angel, who cares, because Angel seemed she might be a pretty cool person that I could have a great conversation with...in the event I lived to pick her up. Well, after surviving the 20 minute ride there, about three minutes away from meeting Angel, the unthinkable happened. I hear the Lyft Robot voice, who sounds like a psycho killer say,

""Lyft Pickup Change""

You know what? It really stinks when you risk your life to drive 20
minutes to pick up Angel, and get a Lyft pickup change notice just as you are about to arrive...and instead of picking up Angel, a smelly dude we will just call Earl, who hasn't changed his underwear for a week, is waiting for you. How would you feel in that situation? Maybe you love the smell of farts, and would drive 20 minutes to pick up Earl, but in my case, I didn't accept that ride on the other side of town and risk my life to pick up Earl. Would you cancel?

That's actually a true story, although the names have been changed to protect those involved, and truthfully, I can't remember if I cancelled on smelly Earl or not. But the point is, a driver may accept or deny a ride for variety of reasons, whether those reasons are valid or not, and yes, I'm aware that you can't discriminate against anyone for any reason. Yet, if I accept a ride request for whatever reason, and Lyft changes that ride on me without giving me a chance to accept or deny that ride, I'm fully justified, as a driver, who is an independent contractor and not an employee of Lyft, to cancel that ride.

On that note, there is another issue here that Lyft needs to address, and that is rides that are placed in a driver's queue automatically, which the driver does not have the ability to accept or deny.

Now, if a driver cancels a ride in his or her queue, as long as that ride is cancelled before the rider drops off his current passenger, that cancellation is not counted against him. Please note that I'm going to keep using the word ""he"" here because I'm a dude (but not as smelly as the mythical Earl), and that yes, I realize that there are female drivers too, who do a great job driving for Lyft, even when they have to pick up smelly ""dudes"" like me and Earl.

That being said, when it gets busy, and ride requests come in one after the other, especially now while the Covid 19 virus is floating around, and there are WAY less drivers out there than there used to be, it can be very difficult to cancel ride request as they come in, and keep in mind, many of these are usually quite literally 19 minutes away, and on the other side of town, and since Lyft DOESN'T PAY ME to drive 19 minutes away to pick them up, I decline many of these rides when I can, because who wants to drive 19 minutes and not get paid for it? Would you?

Well, what often happens is that even if you, as a driver, decline every 19 minutes away ride request that comes in, while your current ride is ending, another ride often gets placed in your queue, and you, as a driver, can't do anything to decline it except cancel it, when it automatically loads as the next ride. In fact, the only thing you can do, as a driver, in these circumstances to block the rides from coming in is to Turn On Last Ride, but the problem is, because you don't ever have the option of declining these rides, and because you, as a driver, have to cancel them, these unwanted rides get counted against you. This can easily happen 5 to 10 times a DAY! Is it fair for Lyft to penalize GOOD drivers like me, to be forced to accept then cancel rides that are 19 minutes away, that Lyft won't pay me for, and then threaten me to deactivate my driver account when I cancel these rides?

That's why I would really like someone on Lyft's management team to review this message, and consider making changes to the Lyft system. In a typical busy Friday or Saturday night of driving, my Lyft cancellations for rides I cancelled might look something like this:

1 Smelly Earl Lyft Pickup Change Cancellation
3 No Show Cancellations
1 Puke Cancellation
1 Unsafe Area Cancellation
5 Cancellations that I did not have the option to decline that were put in my queue as a ride was ending

If you add up the numbers, you get the potential of about 11 driver cancellations a day that are completely justifiable. Sure, these aren't exact numbers, and sure, there are many other reasons a driver may cancel, most of which are justified, and a small minority which may not be justified. That being said, when I cancel a ride, for any reason, in my view, I have very good reasons to do so. Now that Lyft has a better understanding of why some drivers cancel rides, especially some of my reasons for cancelling, I hope that Lyft would consider making at least some changes, especially when the driver cancels rides that are added to his queue as a ride is ending, that he does not have the option to decline.

One final note: I really like driving for Lyft, and I hope I have served Lyft well. Lyft's customer service representatives are always helpful when I have to write you guys (and gals) with problems. As much as I like Lyft, and have attempted to use humor when writing this message (I never actually took a wiff of fat Earl, although at times, I wonder if some of my passengers know what a shower or bath is), I want to remind Lyft that I'm not an employee, and that I'm an independent contractor, and have the Constitutional right to love, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that means making my own, independent decisions about why I may cancel a ride.

The Final Word:

At least show drivers what their cancellation rate is, so that they can keep track of that metric and try to lower it using actual data, rather than trying to guess what that number is, or how far over that undefined threshold will cause them to get deactivated as drivers. I'm sure Lyft has a building full of Lawyers, but ride share companies do get taken to court, which could result in millions of dollars in damages if a judge rules against Lyft in a class action lawsuit for wrongful termination of independent contractors. Just think how much money Lyft could save by taking my advice in this message. You are welcome, Lyft. As always, keep up the good work, and please remove the flag on my account due to too many cancellations, as flagging my account for this reason is totally unfair.

Love,

Keith",2020

post-6592353,Boca Ratman,"Oct 26, 2020 at 3:13 PM","I get a ping, 45+. I accepted, shortly after I received a phone call that I was delivering an envelope. Account holder called back, asked me to wait a few minutes. 

I figured sure, I set lyft to the city of the destination and waited. A few a few minutes later an elderly woman came outside, she seemed angry and anxious and wanted to know why I was in front of her house. I explained, who I was. I asked if she was okay, she said no. 

She was on the phone with someone, obviously uncomfortable with the situation. This made me uncomfortable, with the situation. I asked her what was going on, she wouldn't tell me. 

At this point my spider senses are screaming at me. I stuck around out of concern for the little old lady and also for selfish reasons. The potential of double dipping on a lyft fare and an uber fare plus I need to head down to near that city (65 miles away) for something. 

She went in the house and came back out, I was half expecting the cops to show up any minute. She told me to wait a minute she had to get it ready to transport. She comes out with some papers and a manilla envelope. I asked if I could look inside before I took it. She was very hesitant but then handed me the papers and the envelope and told me to go ahead and count it. 

Brake screech! 

Count it? Wtf? I felt the envelope, felt like two bundles of cash. I asked her if she just handed me cash and again asked if she was all right. She just said no but wouldn't talk to me. 

I started the trip and Googled the address. it was a shopping center in S FL. I handed her the papers and envelope back and told her this doesn't feel right at all. Her neighbor came outside and she called him over, younger guy 35-40. She still wouldn't talk to me but was talking to him within earshot of me, I could hear most of the conversation. 

She had received a call from her grandson. He'd been arrested, blah blah. As soon as I heard that it all clicked. The neighbor knew too, and told me to go. I wanted to make sure the woman knew they were trying to scam her, so I stuck around a few minutes. 

I never looked at the papers or opened the envelope. I let uber know it was a scam account, they haven't replied yet. I am hesitant about cling the police or the critical uber line, knowing uber my account gets deactivated. I told her to call the police and the neighbor said he'd look after her. 

Its an old scam, apparently still effective. I heard her tell the neighbor there was $8,500 in cash and a cashier's check for $10,000 in the envelope. 

I ended the trip, i should have driven to the location or at least half way. Oh well, at least grandma didn't lose all that money.",2020

Here is the story explaining why I gave him 3 stars. Soon after I received a request from Ryan who lives in a luxurious apartment complex, he called me to ask if I could drive to his building. He said it was not a big deal if I didn't wanted to but he needed some time to walk to the front gate. I agreed and then he told me the gate code and directions to his building. Everything sounds fine until I arrived.

This is the first time ever that a passenger signals for a hand shake. Awkward enough, instead of a brief one, he rubbed my hand with his left hand and said ""how come you are so soft and smooth?"" I withdrew my hand immediately and told him that the trunk was ready for his 2 large pieces of luggage. Apparently, he did not get the sign that I was not in the mood for a conversation after giving him minimal replies to the usual questions like ""what do you do?"" and ""how do you like driving Uber?.

He then asked me the brand of hand-cream, shampoo, body wash and perfume that I use. I told him that those questions were too personal. He apologized and said the questions were asked out of curiosity, thinking it would be nice if his wife could use the same products. The 30-minute drive in general was uneventful. As usual, I popped the trunk and stepped aside for him to unload at the terminal. He put forward his hand again but sorry not another time. I then declined politely with a smile and said "" have a good day and enjoy your flight, sir.""

How often do your passengers ask for a hand shake? I do feel it is NOT necessary and appropriate at all.",2020
post-6657998,CocaColaKid,"Dec 1, 2020 at 9:49 AM","So, get a ping 4 min away for a 10 min ride to pick up Shannon.

I pull into the lot, and there are a male and female standing there waiting. Names are confirmed and she gets in. I swipe start UberX and it requests a PIN. I ask Shannon for her PIN and she has no idea what I am talking about. I explain this randomly happens, she just needs to look in her app. She cant find it.

No problem... I hit ""Rider cant find PIN"" and it asks for the last 4 digits of her phone number. That doesn't work either. At this point I learn that Shannon has took many Uber trips and has never had to do this before, like I'm getting a kick out of this. Her friend starts telling me that she is having a bad day, and just to drive them.

I show them my screen, I enter the number in front of them, ride won't start. She shows me the phone number in the app (The last 4 match what we were entering) and I see myself as her driver, so I know this isn't a scam... its an Uber f--k up. 

I tell them I can't do anything at this point, and that's when Shannon demands her money back. I explain I've been paid nothing, and will get nothing until the ride starts... so she needs to contact Uber Support. The passenger tells me that I'm being a dick and getting one star'd for this trip. Well, at this point, I'm not doing the trip even if the PIN showed up on her phone. They were told to exit the vehicle, which they did, leaving both back doors wide open.

I accelerate heavily and the doors close. I U-turn back towards the entrance/exit and the ""PIN required"" disappears. I stop somewhat near the passengers and she starts yelling at me that she isn't going to pay a cancellation fee. No problem, I let her know, I'll cancel on my side and she can make a new request.

post-6410117,LyftUberFuwabolewa,"Jul 29, 2020 at 9:33 PM","So I get a ghetto XL ping… Ghetto XL rides are the worst. Usually they are requesting an XL ride because they have a whole herd of little kids with no car seats, or they have more people that can even fit in an XL ride, or they have a huge pile of stinky laundry in giant cloth bags to go to the laundromat.

As soon as I accept I go ahead and text “Due to the virus I can only carry up to five passengers. All passengers must be wearing facemasks. Any children that require car seats according to state law must have car seats.”

I get no answer nor cancellation. I arrived at the pick up and guess what I’m greeted by? A woman carrying a one-year-old with no car seat!

“Hi. Good afternoon. Is the child going? How old is the child? Do you have a car seat? I’m sorry I can’t take a child without a car seat. It’s against state Law and against company policy”.

Angry look (This isn’t her first rodeo) and a snippy “go ahead and cancel then”. 

As I wait out the timer she toddles off into the house.

I have the message about only carrying five passengers, facemasks are required as our car seats for children saved. When I get a ghetto XL ride I text the message right away.

So far it's not helped. Even though people have kids with no car seats or more passengers than I can carry they don't cancel the ride. I did have one lady text back and say ""no car seats"". Sure enough when I got to the pick up there she was with tiny tots and no car seats.

I guess I need to add to my note that if you can't comply with those three points that they should go ahead and cancel the ride. 

When I get a no-show rider or I have to cancel for too many passengers or no car seats I consider it ghetto tips.",2020

Uber says it is a four minute trip (oh great!). After about a minute of driving the pax calls me and says the address is wrong and then tells me he doesn't need a ride. He just wants me to jump start his car so he can get to work.

I politely explain that we are just here to drive people and that I can't jump start his car. I don't even have jumper cables. He tells me he has some. I again tell him that we are not here to do that and that I would gladly drive him to work if he wants. He continues trying to get me to jump start his car. I finally tell him, ""No, especially not in the pouring rain. We're just not here to do that. Youshould probably call AAA or someone like that to help you do that.""

Customer pauses for a couple seconds and then tells me he is going to physically assault me if he sees me. I tell him that I am going to call the police right now. He hangs up. Cancels the ride. I write a message into Uber about the guy and tell them they should pull the call to listen for themselves.

These riders are getting pretty crazy. No, I'm not going to jump start your car in the pouring rain for $3. For those who don't know jumpstarting cars can damage your vehicle. You have no idea what is wrong with the other person's vehicle. If you really want to help jumpstart cars you should get one of those separate instant boosters which use their own battery. But even then what if it doesn't work and the customer claims you ruined their car? Last issue is it is near the perfect set up for a carjacking. Think about it.",2020

Phone rings while I am in there. Its DoorDash support. I do not answer it because at the moment, I am working for number two (whose number two working for?). Phone rings again. Still I did not answer it. I then set the app to no more delivery offers and shut it off. I concluded what I thought was a great accomplishment which deserves a lifetime toilet achievement award then head out to grab the order. The girl who gives me the order said that DoorDash support called because the customer had a change in the order but that they took care of it and was all set.

I get in my car and start to route and the phone rings again. Its DoorDash support. I answer and the rep tells me the order was changed but they talked to Chipotle and it was taken care of. Then they asked me where I was. I told them that not that it was any of their business but the order was not ready when I arrived so I used the bathroom. She goes on with, ""Well I tried to call you first several times. You must have been in there a long time. The merchant told me you were in the bathroom when I called"".

I asked her what she supposed I do if I am waiting for an order and she says I need to use better time management because it delayed the customer's order. I was thinking, the nerve of this person! She then says she has to call the customer about the delay and happy dashing. Ok?

I arrive at the customer's house and its a meet at the door delivery. They come to the door with a smile on their face.

post-6649726,Benjamin M,"Nov 25, 2020 at 8:21 PM","Lately I have been getting a huge number of pings from JenCare Senior Medical Centers. 

Had one today that I had picked up previously, a very nice old man - that can barely walk, let alone get into and out of my Civic without assistance. 

It took him about six minutes to get into the car today, this time picking him up at his residence and taking him to the clinic. 

While I spent many years doing medical transport (Advanced Life Support and limited mobility BS runs and 911), me trying to assist someone with the possibility of them falling and breaking their hip for $3 (literally this fare) is not happening. 

Got to JenCare, told him to sit tight while I asked for help. A few minutes later, I was greeted by his actual physician, the receptionist, and a nurse - with a wheelchair. It took the three of them about another five minutes to get him out of the car. 

The doctor could not have been more understanding that this is unacceptable, promised that he would be transported in their wheelchair van from now on (parked right there). 

I explained that we get these pings like any other - we are NOT dedicated to medical transport, receive any sort of training, and that many drivers themselves may have physical limitations. She did not seem to understand that, nor do these pax, and thanked me for the information. 

This gentleman was actually going to the clinic because he had fallen and broken several bones - so, an Uber for a high fall risk patient? Triple bypass negative.

It's one thing if a passenger is handicap. It's another if insurance is paying for the trip and the more appropriate solution is a wheelchair van. 

Two pings later, pick up at an ER. Pax was standing with a staff member, no mask. Told the staff member that masks are required, so she went to get one - then dropped it and went for another. 

Meanwhile, the pax kept tugging on the locked door handle. I said three times that she needs a mask to enter. Then she says ""I'll ride in the trunk!"" and meant it. 

Pretty clear that this was a psych patient and I ""noped"" out with ""No mask or face covering"". 

An interesting thing about that ping was that there was an automatic text with an apartment number. I had the same last week in an apartment complex, apparently we are supposed to go directly to the apartment and assist the pax. Again, this is not medical transport. 

I appreciate that these are low income folks and RS is cheaper than medical transport. But I do not have a fancy stretcher, ambulance, or insurance for someone getting hurt. 

So, please, if you have one of these pax - speak up to the staff. The doctor was thankful for the information.",2020

The earnings estimate was from just below $300 to just above. Hell yeah, it was  like Donkey Kong. Then a call from the pax came through; the high value of the ping earned his call being answered by me.

- ""Hey bro, how would you like to earn some money tonight?""

A strange question, I thought. What other reason could there possibly be for me to be out here driving drunks around. Anyway, the images of what the work might entail were already taking turns presenting themselves inside of my head like a slide show. Drugs run? <Click> Dress up in gimp suit? <Click> Getaway driver?

Me - ""Doing what?""
Pax - ""I need you to drive me and my 6 bros to LA in my car. I'm trying to get my car back home. You could have one of your friends follow us in your car so you can get back here. How much do you want to do that? 400 bucks?""

Let's pause the anecdote to examine the pros and cons:

Pros:

400 bucks is on the table. It's a strong first offer. Dude sounds desperate. There'd likely be more money if pushed.

Cons:

I was about to get over when this Range Rover sped up and thwarted my attempt . I got over once he passed and noticed right away that he had no license plate on the back.

The missing plate on this Range Rover made me reflect on my own recent stolen license plate nightmare. I also have a local friend who's plate was stolen this month.

I was behind the Range Rover for a good 30 seconds when he quickly passed two cars and I lost site for a few moments . I then changed lanes and caught up to his car.

At that point I observed that he somehow HAD A LICENSE PLATE on his car. WTF???? Am I losing my mind? I pulled up along side to see who's driving and low and behold ... It was Bruce Fricken Willis! You read that right.

He noticed I saw him and from that point on he wouldn't let me get along side to take a photo of him. I could only keep up from a few cars back.

When I got home I looked up License Plate Hiders and they are a real thing !!! It would make sense that a celebrity of his level would have a James Bondie device like that .

So I make sure it's where he wants to go. Then he says he wants me to wait & we're gonna p\u somebody else & go back.

Of course I tell him I ain't doing no r\t & he's better off just getting another Uber back. He insists on it & I tell him I ain't doing it. He says he's only gonna be a min. so I should wait. I tell him even if he does come back right away which most people don't, I still ain't doing it.

So he asks me why I don't wanna wait so I tell him I don't get paid for the return & I ain't working for free & Uber pays me crap anyways. So he gets this attitude but I tell him I ain't doing it. We're almost there by this time. So he asks what it's gonna take to get me to wait & I tell him I ain't answering that cause he'll complain & lie but I got a dashcam so if he tries it, I'll show he's a liar. So he takes out his wallet & gives me 2 Abes. OK, that'll buy ya 15 min.

So we get there & he goes inside this $ store & in like 2 min. he comes back out & he's walking real fast & these 2 guys are following him. 1 has this little camera & the other guy's waving a cell phone in his face. So he hurries up & gets back in my car & tells me to get outta there. I can't cause the guy w\the camera's in front of my car & the other guy's leaning up against it.

The guy w\the phone starts yelling real loud & asks me why I brought him to meet a 14 YO boy for hankkypanky. So I pointed to the Uber sign on my dash & told him I don't ask no pax why they want a ride, I just take 'em where the app says. So the guy w\the phone keeps asking me real loud if I knew he was coming here to meet a 14 YO boy meanwhile the guy in the back keeps telling me to drive and I keep telling him I can't run over the guy w\the camera who's standing in front of my car

Finally I tell these guys to get outta my way cause I'm about to start losing money. They get real loud about how. Don't I want preds. exposed & I should be glad & helping them out.........

So I tell them they got him on cam so they can go to the popo & the popo knows what he looks like & they got his phone# & they can show that to the popo & they know where & when he was in an Uber so they can show that to the popo so they can get the info from Uber about this guy. So I tell 'em to get outta my way & we're going. They get outta the way & we go. All the way back the guy's telling me it's BS & the t got the wrong guy & all that. I let him out where I picked him up & got outta there. I made a report to Uber & let 'em know I'm saving the dashcam footage.

TLDR-I got a ping to p\u a pedo who thought he was going to meet a boy & get his jollies but it turned out he got caught in a sting by 1 of those Youtube pedo. nabbers.

(I normally don't have any issues with white folks in Uptown Minneapolis btw), Their destination was in downtown area which Lyndale directly connects to, but Lyndale has traffic jams sometimes so I avoid it. That was the time 36th was open before the current construction project on i35W Mouth into Minneapolis. So as I drove south bound towards 36th St. that had i35W North freeway entrance towards downtown, The woman nervously starting saying ""You're going opposite way of where we're going dude"". I sensed some fear in her when she said that, I then calmly told her ""I am trying to get on 36th so I can head towards downtown. And then they reminded me of that scary movie where that Cab driver locked the people in to kidnap them and when they tried to use the pull up lock, it turned out to be a sharp one that cut their fingers. But that incident with those Pax made me wonder if most Pax fear kidnapping or something else from the driver. I think a good chunk of Pax have a fear of the driver himself. If it is a woman driver I am sure their fear would be reduced substantially.

MInneapolis and a lot of Twin Cities in general needed a lot of road and freeway modernization as Cities like Luanda in Africa and China and some other developing countries have surpassed Twin Cities in road and free way/ Bridge quality. We had that i35W Freeway Bridge Collapse which they made a movie about. You don't hear major freeway bridge collapse in a lot of developing countries. I lived in Minneapolis a long time so I am happy to see all the new modernization of freeways and Minneapolis mouth.

I heard Pennsylvania is really messed up in road quality. I hope they start modernizing that bad boy. I noticed they started laying new Asphalt technology in some streets of Minnesota. Hopefully that beats the winter and lasts a long time. Potholes are freaking terrible so driving on bad road quality with bad old Asphalt takes a toll on our tires and wears them out faster, and am sure as an Uber driver you hate that because it means getting new tires or struts or brake pads. Oh speaking of pot hole damage, did you know you can submit a claim to the City or State to get reimbursed for damage you paid to get repaired on your car from a bad pot hole you hit or some bad bump from folded up old asphalt on the freeway? Your struts get damaged you can file, usually the State has a web page dedicated to submitting for re-imbursement of repair you did due to a Pot hole. City of Minneapolis also has that and am sure a lot if not all of US Cities have that.




Below is Luanda Angola. Ain't it crazy when developing African, Chinese etc etc countries like Luanda Angola are beating American cities in road and freeway/bridge quality?

His story went on that he had a loving relationship with his psychiatrist while in law school and she was 62 years old.

He told me that she lost her license to practice medicine as a result! Understandably, his parents were very upset because of the incredible age difference. 

So she is planning to move to Chicago and start a new life with him. He said he was 27 years old, and said she looks decades younger, and the love was real and deep, and she has a ""great figure"".

I thought to myself that I'll just let it slide because I was headed home after this trip anyways, so I didn't plan to report this trip to uber to collect the cleaning fee. I would have just washed the floor mat myself later that day, I was still as nice to her as I was before the spill. One of the reasons I planned not to report it to Uber was that she was a minimum wage worker so I felt pity for her.

A lady hood rat comes out with a paper plate piled with food and a spoon jammed in it. As she approaches the vehicle I ask her if she has something to put the plate of food into and she replies ""I won't spell it"".

I am assuming she's planning on holding it for the duration of the ride which was short. I put the car in gear and pull out and look back and she's already digging into it. I reach up and cancel the ride. I pull over and say I'm sorry but there's no eating. It's in the rideshare community guidelines. She gives me the usual flak and backtalk as she gets out.

I called Lyft to get unpaired from that rider and also to get a cancellation fee. I'm told by Lyft support that because I started the ride I can't get a cancellation fee.

The takeaway lesson? If you think that you forsee a situation with a rider that might lead to a cancellation, go ahead and cancel the ride right away before you start it.

post-5323587,El Janitor,"Aug 24, 2019 at 8:57 PM","I got my message saying it's vehicle inspection time. So I'm a bit nervous because I don't know if my new mechanic who is ASE certified will do it, and I dread going to Jiffy Jube, or some of the other approved Uber / Lyft vehilce inspection stations.

My reasoning is when I first signed up for Uber / Lyft my power windows in the back didn't work. I had them fixed wen't back to my mechanic and the guy from ABC Garage looked around with his clipboard, and approved it but he didn't seem happy about it. Then I hear some people here don't have working AC, working windows and still drive. Iv'e seen cars missing headlights, with all kinds of accident damage and that have been sideswiped driving around with Lyft Uber stickers and passengers inside.

When I went to Firestone once for my inspection. I was told I had a nail in my rear tire and that's a fail, but if I buy a new tire from them it will pass. So I worked as a mechanic, specifically, I cut my teeth mounting tires, patching them, plugging them. My tire was pluggable it was not on the outside of the tread close enough to the sidewall. Firestone just wanted $170 from me on top of the inspection fee. Needless to say I wen't to Costco and they plugged it drove back to Firestone the next day and they were PISSED! However I said, "" Does it pass, or not? The tire is fixed no more nail."" She begrudgingly signed the form.

I'm a car guy I know most of the scams, Iv'e told dealers to put the tires back on my brakes are fine they'll last at least 5,000 more miles, and I'll replace the pads myself, and turn the rotors. You don't need to collect $250 in labor for 40 minutes of work. I'll come back when I can't fix it. Jiffy Lube is an approved Uber vehicle inspection station. This is laughable.

Jiffy Lube damages more cars then fixes them. I can't tell you the horror stories I've heard like a common one,""They didn't tighten my drain plug and my motor seized and they won't replace my motor."" Yes this happens alot there, or they pressure flush your automatic transmission and damage the seals, and charge you to do it. So look I'm not an idiot. When I ask a mechanic a question, and they respond with the wrong answer, you don't touch my car, you don't get my business.

Has anyone had to sit there and be told something so stupid, and asked to pay for a repair that is out of line to pass a vehicle inspection? I hate these stupid things, and I hate being told that somethings wrong when it's someone just trying to take advantage of me. Am I alone in this?",2019

post-6644018,scarshapedstar,"Nov 22, 2020 at 11:18 AM","Each of my last driving days I had two lengthy debates with anti mask passengers. One was young and obnoxious but at least complied. One took his mask down but was so elderly and debilitated I just put my windows down because I'm too nice.

Not anymore. Both of these people feigned open mindedness and voiced at least empathy with my support for science, laws and company policy. I did genuinely try to reason with them. I thought I smoothed things over and never said an unkind word. I even cited my girlfriend, an infectious disease physician, as a source.

And both of them passive aggressively emphasized they were going to tip me well in the app for being civil and informative. As we all know, this is how a certain breed of abusive passenger loves to inform you that you're about to be stiffed.

I won't be driving once I start my job and I feel for anyone who has to continue serving these people. To that end, anyone who uncovers their mouth is getting three seconds to mask up or get dropped off on the side of the road, and they are getting reported. If they give me a bad rating I am happy to push for them to be banned.

These people are terrorists using a position of power to make me put myself at risk for the almighty dollar. And to some degree I desperately need that money. But when you lie to me, when the money is fake, I have no reason to put up with this sh*t at all.",2020

Took all of 10 minutes for his app to shut down. Fired on the spot. Said Uber sent a message about service animals and refused to contact him regarding the situation. Said he went to a Uber hub and after waiting nearly 2 hours he was told to leave and not come back. No discussion about the events at all.

He said he knows he was wrong but he also said he was pretty sure they were not service dogs and the guy was not blind as the guy ran across a 4 lane street at an angle to get to his car and the dogs trailed behind the guy and did not lead the guy at all.

post-6633266,Slackrabbit,"Nov 16, 2020 at 1:08 AM","Ill start with the one funny story. I had a transgender passenger. I keep my radio tuned to an 80's station and halfway thru the ride Aerosmith's 'Dude looks like a Lady' airs. At 1st I was mortified, picturing the rider flipping out, thinking i was discriminating against them etc. But they didnt react negatively at all. Of all times for that song to play... yeesh. 

I got one starred for refusing to take 5 people in my minivan. They ""accidentally called for an uberX. And when we saw you had a minivan we thought it'd be ok"". I explained it wasnt the vehicle capacity, rather Ubers Covid policy and insurance requirements(as if it mattered to them). so i took 3 and the other 2 called another uber. Within 30 minutes of dropping them off i had a 1 star. 

I had a girl throw a can at my van, or rather the passenger inside when he catcalled her. Put a nice dent in the side. 

I had a family of 6, a mom and 5 kids, the oldest of which was 11ish. And 2 cartfulls of groceries. They called for an uberXL but with the new regulations, we can only take 5. I genuinely felt bad for her so i cancelled the uber and drove her for free (well i got the cancellation fee which was ironically larger than the fare would have been). I explained ubers rider limit, and that i cancelled the uber ride but was going to drive her for free. This good deed earned me a good cussing out as they were slowly unloading their groceries. Also made me glad i turned my phone off in case she filed a complaint so my location isnt visible. 

I ran over one of those stupid scooters. The rider jumped off as it coasted right in front of me. Tore up my front bumper, and scuffed the side and rear of my van. The rider of course disappeared before i could get stopped. The following day I contacted the scooter company and told them what happened. I got a canned response and when I sent a more detailed email including pictures of the scooter and my van I got a response to their legal team that they are not liable for things that their Riders do and I need to contact my insurance company to see about getting my car fixed. When I asked for their Riders information so I could pursue legal actions against the writer I was told that they cannot give that out for privacy reasons and I need to contact my automobile insurance company to get my vehicle fixed. 

My last ride of the night was thankfully a short one that completed a consecutive trip quest. As we were driving i hear an ""awwww sh!t i put in the wrong house"" and he updates it to a place 40 minutes further away from my town. At least there was a healthy surge and the fare wound up being $30. While out there i was able to pick up as fare back to downtown. It would take me an extra 20 minutes to get home, but id earn another 20 to 30 bucks. 

This ride was at a very poorly marked venue (on a farm) the rider called to say that her phone was about to die and she would be waiting for me. Once I find the venue, I found her best friend but she was nowhere to be seen. After about eight minutes they found her waiting for me at the other entrance. She is drunk. Not blackout drunk or going to throw up in the back of my car drunk but drunk enough that her friends were worried about her safety in an uber. They are apparently all from small towns and were visiting and had heard all the typical uber horror stories. I insisted that we stopped by a service station so she can buy a phone charger so she could remain in contact with her friends if her phone was so low. She agreed this was a good idea and 5 minutes and $20 (of hers) we're back on the road. She was actually decent to talk to, and i enjoy chatting with riders. It was a 40 minute ride so we covered a lot of ground. Surprisingly we have a lot in common (shes just over half my age) so this ride was going great. Her friends checked on her a few times and she assured them she was fine and i was 'shockingly decent' whatever that means. And then we hit traffic. Thanks to a bad accident and road construction a 40 minute ride turned into an hour and 45 minutes. At this point im super thankful she agreed to get a charger. Her friends would have called in the cavalry. She asked if we could swing by chickfila for ""lemonade and nuggies"". At this point whats another 10 minutes and its literally across the street from her hotel, so i agreed. She bought me a combo, and turns out tipped me $20. But never have i been so happy to end a ride with a passenger i actually enjoyed talking to. And to top it off i spilled my lemonade on the way home. Ugh.",2020

post-6639673,Young Kim,"Nov 19, 2020 at 8:30 PM","There must be something going on with me. I try to be a most patient and forgiving person. But just now, for the first time in my life, I really wanted to ""brake check"" somebody. (That is when you hit the brakes suddenly when someone is tailgating you.) I was driving with a passenger coming off the 90/94S at the 18th street exit in Chicago.

I never go above the speed limit but there was a guy who must have been in a hurry because he was tailgating me so close that I could see his face like he was sitting in my rear seats. Maybe a few inches away. Since I had a passenger, I dismissed of course actually hitting the brakes. But I thought to myself if I was alone, I really would have wanted to do it. He would certainly have hit my car because his was a larger SUV and since mine is a very lightweight Prius I could stop on a dime.

However, I think the headache would be more than it's worth. But it was just a feeling that I had.

Even if you knew you were not going to actually do it, have you ever really wanted to ""break check"" someone? (and if anyone ever has and they hit the rear bumper, what was that experience like?) Of course it would be their fault because they were falling too closely. But I'm wondering if it was worth the headache. Of course when he passed me he gave me the finger. That alone gave me some satisfaction actually. I knew that I didn't do anything wrong because he could have easily just passed me later. It was an off-ramp.",2020
post-6493390,Young Kim,"Sep 3, 2020 at 6:31 AM","Just dropped off lady pax to the south side of Chicago earlier this afternoon. Had a passionate talk about the city's rioting and looting. What struck me was her strong emotions on this... I picked her up from the Enterprise Rent a Car in Park Ridge, IL. When she got in, I saw that the ride was 35 minutes long, going to 24th and King Dr. in the city's south side (the ride took 43 minutes due to traffic).

I started the conversation off by asking her why she rented a car all the way out here in the suburbs instead of a place closer to the city. She told me that renting a car in the city is more expensive because of city taxes, the cars are kept up nicer in the suburbs, and there are few cars for rent in the city where she lives.

Then I asked her how she feels living in the city where so many buildings have wooden planks covering the windows after the destruction and looting. She replied with strong words that it was to be expected by white America, and that Blacks are not necessarily feeling that they are looting/destroying their own community (as the media likes to project), because she said none of it was ""theirs"" anyway.

So she just stopped of saying it should all be burned and looted, but she felt that it is . She is tired of people saying Blacks are irrational because they are destroying what is ""theirs"". She said they are just reacting to having no opportunities and the ransacking of downtown was meant as a statement because the Magnificent Mile is a symbol of the wealth inequality.

She repeated said that white America is being hypocritical by blaming Black Americans, because she stated that America was founded on violence anyway. She said that from the beginning, the whites burned and pillaged (just like what is happening in present cities) at the start of the country.

She brought up about the issue regarding the ""theft of property"" going on, that whites did the same and worse to the Native Americans. Regarding rioting and burning, she pointed out multiple instances where whites rioted and burned just like the Blacks are doing now when there was forced ""school integration"" in the 1950s. So she said violence is at the heart of America's DNA.

She concluded that white America should just keep quiet and try to figure out a solution to the ridiculous wealth disparity going on now. I usually never pick sides, but rather I am a careful listener, and try to understand where people are coming from. I did however, agree with her that in past history (World History), that whenever the wealth disparity got go lopsided, social revolutions followed.

She complained also that politicians are really dragging their feet about the new stimulus, and that made her very angry. Especially because most of the politicians are so wealthy. She said that people love to spend money, so why not stimulate? She said it would help everyone now, because people are suffering presently.

As I dropped her off, we did notice many buildings that were boarded up, and I quietly hoped that all this would stop in Chicago... She extremely friendly, and I wished her well, and that her car would be fixed soon....",2020

post-6599614,The Gift of Fish,"Oct 30, 2020 at 2:05 AM","I got a surge ping from a wooded valley. When I got to the house there was no cell signal and therefore no way of notifying the pax through the app that I had arrived. So I got out and rang the bell at the front gate of the property. No response. I honked the car horn a couple of times. Then I drove up a nearby hill a few hundred yards to see if gaining some elevation would yield me a signal. Nope.

I turned the car back around and drove back past the errant pax' house when he came out. He got in the car, admitting that he knew there was no signal at his house, yet tried to make excuses saying that the app said I was still some distance away.

I set off for his destination and drove about half a mile with him out of the valley and still the signal had not returned. I told him that I know from experience that with Uber, no signal means no pay for me. He told me that many other drivers start the trip from his house and get paid. But there was no way he could know if the drivers got paid or not.

He was already on thin ice for not being out and ready and messing me around at the pick up, so I kicked him out and told him to tell Uber to pay drivers when there is no cell signal if he wanted to complain. I would only have lost a few bucks for the part of the ride when there was no signal, but when Uber stung me last time over a similar situation and refused to pay, I did tell Rohit that if it happened again then I would eject the pax immediately.

Plus, I was in no mood for any bullshit from this pax.

Set DF for 100 miles past my house and headed out the door. Ended up getting 11 pings. 7 reasonably along my route, 4 were me back tracking more than 10 minutes to get a pick-up and maybe get a couple miles closer to my destination. I accepted them all and did the 7 that worked for me and ignored the 4 that Uber should have never sent me and let the PAX cancel. 2 of the 7 that I did carried a surge with them as well.

When I got home I ended up putting 356 miles in for the day, 63 miles more than driving straight home. Those 7 rides paid me $100.20 including $6.08 in tolls or $1.49 per extra mile driven. Plus almost half my normal tolls home were paid.

post-6637761,Stevie The magic Unicorn,"Nov 18, 2020 at 5:56 PM","I was on a residential street, just got my no-show approved and business was slow. It’s one pm so I’m not hurting, not bothered by business being slow.

Good neighborhood so I just parked on the street for a while.

I see a car park and someone dashed out or the car and to the front door or this house pick up an Amazon box and run back. They stop 2 houses down and repeat. I put the car and gear and start following them, they stop in front of a house realize I’m behind them and dash off. I take note of their plate number and call 911. They pull over half a dozen houses down and I see someone run up to a door and come back with a brown paper bag and a drink holder:



I shit you not the porch pirate on top or Amazon orders stopped and picked up someone’s food delivery while they were at it right from in front of their door.



A few minutes later the cops come out and I give my statement. Tell him the plate # and he takes his report.


He goes up to the house and leaves notices that their stuff got jacked but the food delivery victim comes to the door. Next thing I know the cop points to me and the lady walks over.

I roll my window down and she thanks me for taking the time to report it. She goes on to tell me that she’s had Amazon deliveries go missing recently as well.


The cop comes back to ask for the camera footage and I tell him to contact the cab company and they would connect him to people with the power to pull the camera, and get him the correct contact people.


He thanks for the taking the time I head to the company radio shop as I’m not far away.

I tell them at the radio shop that the cops are going to ask for it if they haven’t already.


I’m already down the road done before I get told to bring the car in lol.




So the cops have enough to nail this porch pirate for 3 counts of theft (witness statement on one video evidence on #2 and #3.

post-6340269,FLKeys,"Jun 29, 2020 at 11:21 AM","Saturday night, Sunday morning, just before 1 am things are slowing down and lots of ants still out. I am parked outside one of the few spots left open to get a ride, about 25 miles from home, so I set DF to home and hope I get a ride at least part of the way toward home. About 10 minutes go by and I get a ping 2 minutes in the wrong direction however it is 18 minutes toward my destination. Great, I accept it.

Get there and there are two people outside a bar, 1 smoking and the other just milling around. About 2 minutes of waiting and the person smoking goes back in the bar. The other person continues milling around. About 30 seconds before the shuffle time pops up the person milling around walks up to my window and identifies himself as my PAX, I confirm his name and ask destination before unlocking the door to make sure it is the way I want to go. His destination is strange, a restaurant that closed over 2 hours ago, kind of a remote place for this area.

PAX gets in and we head toward destination. PAX is quite at first then starts asking strange questions and making strange comments. Nothing offensive just strange. I can hear him digging through his small backpack several times. I start getting that uneasy feeling.

He says in a mumbling voice that he is glad he will be starting a second job soon. I ask him where and he says I can't remember, it's South. I ask is it a hotel or restaurant and he says I guess I should have asked. At this point my creep alarm is on super high alert. I nonchalantly confirm my self protection tools are properly staged and I move my pepper spray to a quick grab position. Manually unlock my door, and make sure my seat belt release is not obstructed. I just had a bad feeling at this point.

My standard procedure is start trip and take a snap shot of the waybill. Second guessing I did that this time and my creep alarm going overboard I take another screen shot of the waybill just to make sure I have it. About a minute after doing this the PAX asks did you take a picture? I simply say I took a screen shot of my trip information for my records. At this point we are two minutes from destination. He replies I thought you took my picture. I said no need to do that the dash cam records everything and saves it to the cloud (okay the cloud part was a lie but he had no way of knowing that). I also point at that dash cam that is obviously right there. He implied he never saw it. 

We pull up to the restaurant and I ask him do you want dropped in front or on the side? He replies oh go past the restaurant and turn right on the first road, I live in the first building on the right. I do that and stop at the first building. He says no go to the end of the road and turn left and I am in the first building on the right. Okay there is no building on the right after you turn left, now my creep alarm is really going into overtime. I stop in the very back of the complex about 200 yards from the road and just stare at him through the mirror. He finally gets out and I immediately lock the doors and start driving off. I turn the corner and head out to the side road. I get to the stop sign at the main road and make a quick entry in my log book, maybe 30 seconds at the most. I look in my mirror and the PAX is walking toward my car. What the.....I hit the gas and turn on to the main road and get the heck out of there.

Now for this guy to get to the road that fast after I dropped him off he had to be running back to the road through the complex. I thought for sure this guy was going to try and rob me or something, I have never had such a bad feeling from a PAX in the 2+ years I have been doing this.

I was constantly evaluating my options once my creep alarm started going off and hoping I would pass a deputy sheriff on the side of the road like I usually do in this area and time of night, no luck. Because of the lack of cars on the road I figured my best option was to just be ready and finish the trip. While watching the dash cam footage this morning of the ride I got that same uneasy feeling. I think this guy was up to no good and started second guessing himself.

Saturday morning, toes on the curb at 615 for a 630 ride. Driver pulls up. As she is moving toward the back door, the driver gets out, rushes around, opens front passenger door. She’s smacked in the face with the smell of weed. She looks in the back seat and sees it’s packed tight with garbage. Still, she gets in while this dude is holding the door open.

He’s also staring at her a lot. She tells him there’s no way to get her to work on time off the interstate. He finally relents. 

On the interstate, he tells her she smells really good. She’s pressed against the passenger door to get a little distance from him. Pop! Blowout. He doesn’t call for roadside, doesn’t contact support. She finally cancels the ride and books another driver. She says nothing about it while he’s changing the tire. Car pulls up, he waves the new driver off (not knowing it’s another Uber). She books ass to the other car, jumps in, and they speed away. She clocked in two minutes early.",2020

In fact you see car carriers hauling cars that look like they would be headed to the crusher but they're not, they're headed to the local ""Auto Mall"" where people buy these smashed up poorly maintained vehicles.

In fact you see these total jalopy vehicles with paper temporary tags. Somebody just got their ""new"" car!

At a glance you can easily spot a handful of inspection violations. Things like no headlights or taillights, cracked windshield, missing mirrors, and belching smoke like a coal fired locomotive just to name a few.

One thing all these cars have in common is the paint's clear coat and some of the color coat below is weather etched away to some degree from all the horizontal surfaces. It makes me wonder if they don't bring these cars up from the south.

I kept thinking ""How do these cars make it through inspection?"". Even if you could get the inspector to look the other way about the missing/broken lights and mirrors, bald tires, bad brakes, etc, there's no way the vehicle would pass the part of the test where they connect the state's inspection computer to the car's OBD2 port and read the VIN and any check engine light error codes.

Then it hit me! [game show winning answer bell: ""ding ding ding ding""]. They buy cars so old that they have no OBD2 port. That way the inspection is merely a physical/visual inspection by the inspector and they put a smog sniffer in the tail pipe. The inspector certifies that he put the smog sniffer into the vehicle needing inspection but of course that's not what he does. He uses a different vehicle that can pass the smog test. Then gets a wad of cash from the ghetto car owner and slaps a valid inspection sticker on the windshield.

I just finish dropping someone off and I get a ping. Had to look twice than grabbed a screen shot. Go it on the flash but you can still see it.




Had to accept it, some quick math and that is like 5 days of driving. I am only 2 minutes away, not sure why the app say 6 minutes. I get there and a lady comes out and tries to open my door, which of course is locked. I roll down the window and ask her where are you going? She names a Hotel about 2 miles away. I start the trip and this pops up.




Now estimate shows 78 hours. I show the rider and ask her to change it in her phone. She looks at her phone and says it shows the hotel. I check her phone and sure enough it shows the hotel. I ask her to call me through the app, she does and the call comes through fine.

App could not come up with a route.




Here is the Waybill




I took her to the hotel and ended the trip like normal.

By the way Google maps only showed it as a 22 hour trip. Not 78 hours or 7213 Minutes (120+ hours). Heck Anchorage, Alaska is only 80 hours away.

Since 2 updates ago the app has been doing all kinds of crazy things. Also 90% of my rides the count down timer does not start running when I arrive, so if the PAX does not show up I can not cancel for No Show.",2020

He was taking it personally I didn’t tell him my life story when he asked how I was, then tells me how I shouldn’t be an Uber driver. Then eventually said he didn’t feel safe and was going to call Uber support on me. 

So I pull into a parking lot and tell him the ride is over. He begged I continue the ride and claims he never said he was going to call Uber support. But when I wouldn’t continue the ride he calls 911. 

He’s got the call on speaker and 911 doesn’t seem to understand why he’s calling them and asks if I have any weapons. I yell “no I don’t have any weapons” he eventually ends the call and gets out. At the end of the call 911 operator tells him they’re sorry this happened to him.",2020

post-5864245,Darkseid777,"Feb 9, 2020 at 5:13 PM","The reason I finally quit after a year in working for all of these clowns (food delivery apps) was because of the fact that it was nothing more then a buildup to that fact finally occurring.

I finally had enough with being blamed for things that where out of my control whether having to deal with traffic, construction issues on the road, bad drivers, bad weather, and everything else in between.

I finally had enough of playing this where's waldo game with the customers who for some reason could never give me their right addresses let alone their correct telephone numbers or delivery instructions on where to drop the food and always expecting me to do door to door deliveries. I'm sorry but this is not get the door it's domino's they should come outside and meet you I'm a courier remember I'm not your babysitter that was expected to hold your hand.

Also forget about dealing with customer service between all these delivery apps because they were useless and beyond destruction and people wonder why their food was always late never mind the fact that once I got to the restaurant the food was never ready and that was with all of them not just Uber or Doordash.

A total lack of organization from top to bottom and who gets blamed for all this horse hockey the driver, what finally happened in making me quit was because I was on a double delivery for Doordash. The first order ended up being late to be dropped off because of the fact that I had to wait for the second order to be prepared and to make the drop off for that customer.

So to make a long story short I got into a shouting match with the customer who's order was late trying to explain to them what was going on and they didn't want to hear it so I lost it with them and cussed them out and slammed the telephone on their face and it was a long time coming.

After 500++ deliveries between all with these cats combined and this is how it ended and thank god I say and good riddance I should have quit a long time ago and as far as I'm concerned so should everyone else!!! I wasn't even making minimum wage for god sakes!!! if you factor in the gas that had to be pumped on a constant bases and maintenance of the car.

I had all my accounts deactivated and cut up all the debit cards and it felt great once it was finally done. There is a brighter future for me over the horizon and I will be moving on to the next adventure in my life and will be better off in doing so.

These app companies are nothing more then a detriment to society it has created a new legion of lazy bums who don't want to go out and even pickup their food anymore let alone eat at the restaurants either.

The drivers are now nothing more then truck drivers on a miniature scale spending all their time on the road living lives of solitude, stress, and pressure to make a few peanuts and are getting screwed by the customers in terms of not being tipped and having to deal with their attitudes of entitlement and bad behavior and also by the restaurants not caring when they hand the food off to the driver.

But least of all the restaurants are being screwed by these app companies with their god forsaken fees that they are being charged to use their services so everyone is being destroyed except for those at the top of these fly by night companies.

like I said before the sooner these app companies die and the sooner this entire gig economy dies the better we will all be for it. I've even heard as of recent that Uber and Doordash were trying to merge that's just what we need one great big incompetent corporation.

Oh and by the way I worked out of the Portland Oregon Metro market one of the worst places in terms of traffic and road conditions in the country especially due to the weather and all the construction constantly going on and having bad infrastructure over all.

post-5507952,MondayMan,"Oct 22, 2019 at 1:57 PM","I got scammed.

I got a ping 3 minutes away, rolled up exactly to the pin and started waiting for ""Cristina"" (no idea if that's her real name). A minute later a man came walking up to the car, said his girlfriend had accidentally put in the wrong address, and asked me to drive to their house around the corner. It was close enough that my countdown timer was still running, so I didn't think anything of it. Then Cristina got in the car and I swiped to start the ride.

She was headed to a bank in Lower Manhattan, about an hour from the starting point. It was the first stop in a multi-stop trip. I said, ""Oh, you're going to New York?"" She said yes. I said, ""And you are stopping somewhere along the way?"" She said no, she was only going one place and she didn't know why it would say that. Again, I didn't think anything of it, and I started driving.

I drove her to the city, which took right at an hour. I took exactly the route Google Maps gave me. Along the way we talked about our kids, her job, her mother, her career goals, etc. It was mostly pleasant except for the terrible things she said about the customers who come into her workplace. When we were almost there she said she was hungry and would like to be dropped off at a deli a couple of blocks away from her destination so she could buy some food and then walk to work. I stopped at the curb in front of the deli, and she thanked me and said goodbye.

When I swiped to end the trip, I had to first swipe to ""confirm stop"" because she had accidentally (or so I thought) entered it into her app as a multi-stop trip. When I swiped, I saw the next stop come up:


Canada. Not somewhere else in the NY/NJ metropolitan area, not somewhere else in America, not even anywhere specific in Canada. Just Canada. I chuckled, took a screenshot, and swiped ""confirm stop"" again. Then I saw ANOTHER stop in the trip, which was the original address of the starting point of the trip an hour away. I thought this was weird, but it's the kind of thing someone could do if they're really bad at using the app. I swiped to complete the ride and headed back home to New Jersey.

My pay for the trip was $72.15, which included $39.00 in tolls because we went from NJ to NY and then crossed the Verrazano. (For those of you not from the NY/NJ area, that is not an unusual toll amount for a trip like this.) A few hours later I looked and saw that my gross earnings amount had been adjusted down to -$1.28, which means all of my pay and tolls had been taken away, and I still had to pay for the the extra per-mile insurance I opted into. I am still working with the fine folks in India to get my money back, and I might have to make a 2-hour round trip to a Greenlight Hub to get this cleared up.

Thinking through it after the fact, it's obvious what happened. The pax (who acted nice and talked with me about kids and careers and life goals) set me up so that she could call in and claim I never gave her the ride. By her design, the ride didn't start at her requested start location, it didn't end at her requested end location, and it didn't go to the locations of the additional stops. Free ride to the city for her, hours of difficulty and frustration for me.

Here is the moral of the story that I will take away and suggest to all of you: Start your trips at the start pin, end your trips at the end pin, and confirm extra stops with the pax before you start rolling. If start location, end location, or extra stops need to change, instruct your pax to change them in the app. If they will not, either cancel the ride or take them where the app says to take them even if they might rate you poorly.

And to Cristina, if you're out there reading this: I hope you're doing well, that work has been going better for you this week, and that your baby boy is sleeping better. I understand it must be hard to make ends meet while you take care of this baby and commute back and forth to the city. I forgive you for what you've done to me. But I hope you will make it right and not do this to anyone else.",2019

post-6590971,Kurt Halfyard,"Oct 25, 2020 at 9:53 PM","So I was 17 points from Platinum Status this morning, so I turned the UBER App on after noon, looking to get 6 short rides at 3 points a piece -- to lock in Platinum until the end of January 2021.

Got a couple short rides while I did my Sunday errands.

Eventually, I got a ride to Pearson Airport (TORONTO), and then another ride (not a rematch) downtown.

Lakeshore Boulevard was closed, and thus it was a special kind of  on Fleet Street.

While i was waiting for many light cycles to eventually turn left onto Ft. York, I heard on the radio that the COVID-19 cases in Ontario had crossed 1000/day for the first time. I thought perfect, I get one more ride on DF, and I hang up the keys until things settle for a while.

On the 6th ride, from Bathurst/FortYork to Church & Charles, PAX dropped their pin on the wrong condo, and I was about to shuffle, after texting the woman and her boyfriend, why I was on Bastion instead of at her Condo, they eventually walked to me. She gives me some flack about the address. I show where she dropped the pin, and that I am exactly where the pin is. I tell them I have no info beyond that

Thus, the ride begins on the wrong foot.

However, I recovered, when the dude really like the interior leather styling of the my car, so we talk about that for a bit. I tell them I'm impressed that after 5000 rides, and 3 years of driving, mainly the night shift, that the leather has held up so well. She asks me if anyone has every puked in the car. I tell her that I'm picky about the kind of drunk I may or may not pick up at 3am. She asks me what is the worst thing has happened. I tell her the story about the dude that got in covered in blood on Mercer St. after being in a full street fight. And how I didn't know at the time, as it was dark, lesson learned about the super late drunk shift. No bad pukers though.

We are driving up Spadina and turn onto Wellesley. 

To make matters worse, as I approach Church street, there is an Ambulance with full sirens and lights coming up behind me (about 6 cars back) as I am at the intersection.

There are cars parked on both sides of Wellesley so nowhere to pull over, and it is wall to wall cars behind me.

As the light turns yellow, I make my left turn onto Church Street in the north direction. Right into an oncoming Fire Engine coming south on Church. The fire truck was in the wrong lane to negotiate the intersection.

I did not hear the fire truck because of the Ambulance.

We miss collision by about 10 cm (That's about 4 inches).

Passengers in the back are freaking out with a window full of fire truck! I manage to pull onto the east side of Church to take a breather.

I told the lady-pax. Congrats. In all of my 3 years of Gig-Driving, that was the most dangerous thing that ever happened. You get to be part of the story. She was not impressed.

Either way: 

And it was also the universe giving me an unambiguous sign to take a good long break from Ridehail/Gig Driving (as per my 1000/day resolution to stop driving).

I hopped on the highway, after that and drove home.

I told myself I was going just stay home because I expected craziness.....but I like a challenge and adventure and around 7 pm I ventured out to do Lyft....and i must say each and every ride was crazy as you would expect ...it started with a air port pick of a guy who cant speak english that couldnt find the pick up zone...then a very rude very ghetto young lady who stared me in my face as I sat in front of the mall waiting for her for 5 mins and when i called with a nasty ghetto attitude says ""im right here in front of you"" and gets in the car huffing and puffing...then the very very ghetto couple who when I pull up just started berating me because they wanted a suv to pick them up...and the boyfriend was actually being threatening as i asked them did they want to order another ride...then Lyft added a trip while they was in route to their motel..but they had a popeyes stop...so then i started getting bombarded with angry text message from the very very ghetto young lady that was my next ride telling me i ""need to speed because she got thing to do""...i drop off the couple and say yall have a good night and got a ""whatever"" from the boyfriend...and i promptly cancel the angry texter chick...but the icing on the cake was saved for last...i got a drug addict schizophrenic escaping rehab 2 in the morning and had me drive 2 hours to drop her off at her drug dealer house as she talked to me about seeing dead people and hearing voices....I must say Halloween 2020 was everything I expected it to be and then some!!!",2020
post-6124840,Young Kim,"Apr 14, 2020 at 6:32 AM","Violence in the South and West Side of Chicago are soaring since the outbreak. Recently, I almost got shot. I was driving at 3 PM, in the middle of the AFTERNOON on the West side (1100 and Monroe cross street) to pick up a pax named Stephanie. A group of men were in a car about a block ahead of me as I approached the pickup spot, and one ran fast across the street and got a gun, spun around and shot multple times into the other men's car. I stopped just in front of the line of fire... if I was just a few seconds early... The shooter sped away and so did the other car, I don't know how many died. I took off too.

Another rider, female, I picked up in the city and drove her to the South Side. She proceeded to do drug deals out of my car. I told her NO when she came back with an thick large envelope (for sure drugs, as I saw her pull out a large pack of money from under her pants before),....she then grabbed her purse and pulled out pepper spray and got into a pepper spray fight with another female. I tossed out her phone onto the grass and sped off as two men ran towards my car and screamed, ""Get your bitc* out of her, which is ridiculous as my car has Uber signs all over it. In both cases, I genuinely feared for my life. Today I reported the incident and asked the rider be deactivated. I realize that I could not refuse to drive the passenger INTO the South Side, but of course I can turn off the app once there, which I did. Please be especially care to all of you I say, use great caution if you are in the area because with the warmer weather the crime and shootings jump higher in Chicago's dangerous neighborhoods. Please stay safe everyone. Happy Belated Easter to all. (I tried to contact Uber's emergency number during the ride...but there was no answer. As for calling the police... I thought it foolish to stay there in the area and filing a report is futile).",2020
post-6562834,Mista T,"Oct 10, 2020 at 12:15 PM","A friend was telling me of her horrible Uber experience yesterday. She was getting an Uber to work. The first driver farted around for 5 mins, then called her and asked her to cancel the ride, claimed his car wouldn't start. She had to get to work, so she did it. Free $$ for the driver, lol.

The second driver was taking her to work and he gets a phone call. He answers it and rambles on in some other language for about 5 minutes, then his phone died. Uh oh... he plugs it in, and tries to turn it on every 20 seconds. Meanwhile he is still driving, but he is going 15 in a 40.

My friend is concerned about getting hit from behind, but whatever. It's his car.

My friend says she could tell him where to turn. It's the same route she takes 5 days a week, so she knows the way pretty well, as well as the alternatives. He ignores her and continues to proceed at 15 mph.

The phone finally gets enough juice to turn on. Eventually the Uber app comes up and the guy freaks because he is about to miss a left turn. Without warning he jolts left and almost gets them T-boned.

My friend is having a mental heart attack and says ""That car just missed us by a foot!"" The guys says ""We're fine."" and keeps driving.

The drivers phone rings, and (naturally) he answers it. My friend is panicked and furious - what a fun combination of emotions!

Like a good pax, she kept her mouth shut.

One star and a lovely write up about it all to Uber.

As she is telling me this, all I can think about is that this is the result of lower and lower pay. Time to buy a car, sweetie. It costs more, but you'll live longer.",2020

Picked up back-to-back rides from a federal prison tonight. Yes, there’s one in my area south of the city.

Apparently there was a release of prisoners deemed ‘non threat’ to thin out the prison population due to Covid.

No big deal, these guys don’t want to go BACK to prison so I didn’t have a problem with it.

But man, driving up on a federal prison is menacing, especially at night when I was out.",2020
post-6343855,LyftUberFuwabolewa,"Jun 30, 2020 at 8:46 PM","... because all I have is hindsight.

As we all know because of the COVID-19 virus we are not supposed to touch a passenger's belongings.

Well I accept an Uber ride and arrive at the pick up and it's a woman in a wheelchair and there's nobody there to help her. This means I'd have to handle her wheelchair.

Before any of you light your hair on fire, I've carried an untold number of people with wheelchairs, walkers, etc. I have no problem with that and I do it all the time.

However now that were under this whole thing with COVID-19 if I handle the persons belongings I'm putting myself and the company at risk to be sued. Congress still has not yet passed any limits on COVID-19 liability.

So I asked the woman if there's anyone who can help her with the wheelchair. She says no. I informed her that we're not supposed to handle a persons belongings. I was about to cancel the ride but I really didn't want to leave the woman stranded. Not because I was worried that I would get reported for refusing to carry somebody with a wheelchair since I would only be following the companies rules about not touching a person's belongings. I didn't want to leave her out of sympathy. I'm realizing now that I'm probably going to get one starred for doing my good deed.

So I asked her if she's OK with me touching her wheelchair and she said that was fine. She gets in the car, I put the wheelchair in and off we go.

Then three times during the ride she mentions that she's going to call up Uber and ask him about this thing about a driver not being able to touch her riders belongings.

It was at this point that I realized that she was a lot more pissed off than she was appearing, and she was also failing to see that I had done a good deed by bending the rules in order to accommodate her. She clearly was not appreciative.

When the ride was over I called Uber to ask what I should do in a situation like that where there's a rider who needs physical assistance yet at the same time we're under a company wide rule of not touching a passenger's belongings.

All I ever got back from the company was an email with the standard boilerplate stating how we are always supposed to make every attempt to assist a writer with a disability. I guess they're more afraid of those kinds of lawsuits then a COVID-19 lawsuit.

Oh and by the way I did get the one star and a service complaint from that limp legger as well.

So this only makes me more dedicated to following my own role that you either: A. Cancel a ride before starting it or B. Drive the ride with a smile without any complaining. Complaining and then driving the ride or driving the ride while complaining only guarantees you problems.",2020

Need two more rides to finish up for the night and I’m in the downtown area. Get a ping for a pick up at a club.

So I pull up as close as I can get and no pax to be seen. Time is ticking down, eventually the back door opens, I turn around in time to see two guys with ‘security’ written on their backs dump this drunk chick in my back seat and close the door, without saying a word to me.

Her last conscious act was calling her girlfriends who were still in the club, I heard the call go to voicemail as she flopped over passed out.

Great. (nice ‘girlfriends’ I thought to ditch their friend in this condition)

So on we go, luckily she only lives about 8 minutes away because I was worried she’d throw up in her sleep.

We get to destination, she lives in a row house on a narrow street and I can’t get her to wake up to get her out of the car, so I park on the sidewalk/yard so I don’t block traffic. 

I open the back door, yelling to try to get her awake, literally have to sit her up in the seat, she comes to enough, I tell her to put her feet out the door, she says ‘yes sir’ and puts one foot out and slumps over passed out again. I get her to come to again, this time both feet out the door and she manages to stand up, every time I ask her to stand up, it’s ‘yes sir’ she must’ve thought I was a cop.

I hand her her purse and phone and she’s looking in my car asking ‘where’s baby?’

‘Who’s baby’ I ask?!

‘Luna my dog she was in there.‘

Great, now I’m wondering if it’s just booze she’s had tonight. Hallucinating her dog was in the car and I’m trying to reason with someone out of their mind that her dog isn’t in the car.

I finally convince her the dog is in her house, she mumbles something about ‘Luna’ breaking her leg as I help her up the steps. 

I wait on the top step making sure she makes it inside and swipe this damn ride as OVER.

Ok, this is wrong on a lot of levels. We’ve all heard the horror stories of what happens to women with unscrupulous RS drivers. But regardless this girl should not be alone in this condition. Two security guys knowingly dump her into a car without even checking out the driver? 

Also, it was obvious she’s going home to a dark house, no one there, she could throw up and choke to death, or unwanted boyfriend could show up, any number of things. Too vulnerable in her condition. Someone should’ve gone home with her. Club security should’ve seen to that.",2020

One more minute ( 4 and a half on the timer) and the front door opens. Pax gets to the car and tries to open the door. ""You need to have a mask"" I tell him.

""It's in my pocket"". He tries the door again.

"" You need your mask on!""

""It's in my pocket!"" He tries door.

""I reach for the phone, and say, "" Put your mask on!""

He pulls out his mask and puts it on. I unlock the door, ""You didn't have to yell"". 

"" sir, I asked you 3 times for your mask. That was your last chance before I left.""

""Only if you add the stop on the app""

""Why not?""

""Do you want a $100 tip?""

Sure

""Answer a question. Are you voting for Trump?""

""I don't want your money!""

What made this ride stick out was that he told me that he was a graffiti artist who tagged a bunch of businesses and public areas in downtown Chicago. I drove him up to Libertyville, IL, so it was a very long ride. He showed me a bunch of pictures and gave me his Instagram page where he puts up his work. He said that every single one of his friends are not white. Dad works for FedEx as a delivery driver and tells him whenever he sees his son's work as he drives around Chicago delivering packages for FedEx. Funny thing is that he told me his dad was actually proud to see his graffiti all over Chicago.

Even though he lives and works so far in the suburbs, he told me his one mission right now is to save enough money to move back to the city. There, he says he can hang with ""his homies"". He says he can't get along with other whites, and would rather date non-whites. I asked him if I could put up some of his images on UP.net and he was so happy to give me permission. He said he found it absolutely thrilling to ""tag"" especially downtown landmarks. Unfortunately, he told me that some of his crew were snagged by the Chicago Police for tagging ""The Bean"" (a large art statue in Millennium Park). He was very atypical, very anti-establishment, into theories of MK ULTRA and believing that the government is a truly evil entity bent on subordinating the ""innocent lost sheep"" as he liked to call the people.

I was at the local watering hole and some guy came up to me and starting striking up a conversation. I am normally cool and talk to everyone, but this guy seemed downright strange. He kept working his way closer and closer to me and then I walked away. I am a strong believer in personal space. I sat at the bar and proceeded to order another drink. This same guy came over and just sat down next to me. I said ""Sir, I am saving that seat for someone"". He looked around and laughed. At this point, I moved to another part of the bar. This guy started to move over and I told the bartender to tab me out and she noticed the situation and did not hesitate. I quickly got on my phone and ordered the Uber. 

The pricing was at surge and the driver was 7 minutes away. I said ""Sh*t"" under my breath. I signed the receipt and started to head for the door and the guy was chasing me at this point. I walked outside and waited for my Uber driver. The guy came out of the bar and I just stated that I was waiting for my ride. 

The truck the Uber driver is in pulls up and the guy pulls me by the arm and I pull away and just say ""Leave me the hell alone"". The Uber driver then places his truck into park, steps out calmly, and pulls a switch blade. He says nothing and the guy lets me get into the truck. I am scared and the driver insists I sit up front. He tells me that he had to do that several times before, but he has never had to do that for another guy. I thank him for the ride, tipped him $10, and got home SAFELY.

She kept pointing, then signaling to stop, then pointing further away, etc etc (while on the phone and walking) for a good while. I asked where we were going, no reply.

24 minute ping to an Italian restaurant (that's basically every trip here now) at around 2pm. Again, on the pin, texted ""I have arrived"".

Out of necessity, I began delivering food yesterday. Made $70 in three and a half hours, today around $100 in around five.

Saw some things that made me chuckle.

People wearing masks alone in their car or riding bikes / jogging with nobody around. There's no evidence that this is airborne, folks. Person to person. But pollen is pretty nasty right now.

People wearing masks with their nose not covered. Know where they insert the swab to test for COVID-19? (Well, technically, nasopharynx). Wear it properly or don't wear it.

Advance Auto, associates think that it's a better idea to handle items brought to the counter and then taking your credit card or cash, pushed back and forth on a cart. Not washing their hands. They've managed to actually INCREASE contact.

And their delivery guy, buddies, other associates? Oh, they know them, so no need to do anything differently. Because it's just ""stranger danger"", right?

Grocery store. I was standing on the ""six foot"" mark, moved maybe three inches from it and the associate told me to step back. Then, came around the Plexiglas divider they've put up (again, still handling items, and it's pretty pointless), about 14 inches from me, to say ""thanks for not buying more [TP] than you need"".

And maybe that's the problem - I got a taste of a pretty good hourly rate for a few weeks, now my rate is down about 20%. It's hard to take a pay cut.

I've been part time for about 20 months - 4,300 rides total. I did stop for about 10 weeks when Covid started..I know much of the below is obvious, but I thought I would list what I've seen lately.

It was slow last night and I (FOOLISHLY) accepted a 4.66 STAR passenger, lets call her ""N"" who happened to be nearby at 10:40pm, and was (via Uber Pro's time and direction info) doing a halfway decent length trip on UBER.
I arrive in the condo-townhouse complex.
Three people smoking on the stoop.
N walks towards me with a pizza box (Pizzaiolo, Small) in her hand.
I roll down the window as she approaches and ask, ""Do you have a face covering?""
She holds up a mask in her hand.
I say, ""Can you please put it on?""
She says, ""Yes"" while trying the handle.
I roll down the passenger rear window, ""I'm going to need that on before you get in the car.""
She angrily THROWS the pizza box in my car (nearly hitting me in the head).

Enough of this. I haven't started the ride yet. Count down timer is still going. Time to SHUFFLE for No-Mask.

She starts screaming behind me.

I leave the complex and notice that she has also flung her phone into my seat.

I am driving along Thomas St. in Mississauga and am about to pull over when a JEEP pulls up behind me at high speed, then make a sharp swerve in front of me at the Thomas Glen-Erin Light. There is no traffic at that hour. 
Her two smoking buddies (dudes) get out of the jeep and cross their arms. She comes running out, ""You STOLE my phone *******."" 
I reach in the back seat, grab her phone, and hand it to her, silently. I'm not going to escalate this any further. She gives me the finger, and screams again as she gets back into the Jeep. Her pals do a 'donut' around my car in the middle of the intersection. Another driver who has stopped at the red light on the other side of the intersection looks on with curiosity.

I drive off to another block, park on a side street and end the ride, selecting ""NO MASK""
I discard the pizza box left on my seat from the throwing incident. (It is garbage day tomorrow in this neighborhood, so I just leave it with one of the houses curbside pile of trash, which had a few Pizza Nova boxes off to the side).

I file a report with Uber's App ""Trip Issues"" but have to attach it to another previous in the day cancelled ride (as the last ride doesn't show up in my history, because the ride was not started beyond the 'count down clock screen'.)

I get another ride request while I'm doing that. Just before I drop off the passenger, I get a phone call from the UBER Safety Team. But I let it go to voice mail, as I'm still completing this current ride.

I call them back, and talk to the person, explaining the above to UBER Safety -- passenger N with the 4.66 STAR rating was out of line with throwing objects into my vehicle, and then chasing me down at speed on a residential roadway. They say they will look into it.

My account goes ""OFFLINE"" minutes later. with the BLUE STRIPE in the driver app, ""YOUR ACCOUNT HAS AN ISSUE""

Ancient Corporate Proverb: No good deed shall go unpunished

Currently the account is temporarily on hold, but when I try to log in, it says,




I filed another email-ticket with UBER Support (I can no longer send texts through the app due to lack of ability to log in.)

UBER SUPPORT got back to me at 6:52am this morning, saying all was cleared up, but I still cannot log into my account. (I cannot log into my passenger account either, same issue.)

post-6590310,Frontier Guy,"Oct 25, 2020 at 2:39 PM","Everyday I see more and more of these articles about how badly airlines are treating passengers, then I listen to my wife comment on the things she hears from from airline passengers (she works at Denver Int'l Airport). Yesterday morning, dropped these two women at the airport, both were not looking forward to the flight. They travel every two weeks Denver to NYC, just listening to the BS they put up with on their flights.

After dropping them off, I got a rematch, a pickup on the opposite side of the airport, ""Terri"", I pull up, Terri is there with a friend, they are both FA's for Delta. The entire 35 minute drive to take them home, I listened to them bash passengers and how disgusting they are, that they want to kick them out in mid-air., how they want to hit them, etc.. 

After listening to both sides, and knowing what we drivers put up with, I've decided to side with the riders, and will no longer give rides to flight crew. If I pull up to the pickup and it's a crew member, I'm simply going to cancel the trip, eat the cancel, and drive off, let them figure out a different way. Quite frankly, they want to treat passengers like crap, maybe they should understand what it feels like to be treated like crap too.",2020

Lots of winery traffic, tons of visitors, weddings, and a gorgeous fall day was the perfect combination. My final ride of the evening was a Waffle House scheduled pickup at about 11:30 pm. I thought (of course) that ""nothing good is waiting at Waffle House after 10:00 pm"" but decided to check it out, it was on my route home and a 15 minute trip. Four (very!) nice young women were waiting, probably grad students. All holding coffee cups, all clearly intoxicated. Due to the way the parking lot wraps around, I was on them before I could cancel, and they immediately approached the car. I rolled down my window and said ""Uber X is maximum three passengers due to Covid guidelines."" (I no longer take four under any circumstances.) The response was, verbatim; ""Don't give us that bulls.h.i.t.! (Instant cancel decision made.) We have been taking Ubers all day and not a single driver said a word. Besides, it's FOUR, not three."" My response; ""Sorry girls. This is clearly shown on the Uber app, it is definitely THREE."" At this point I still can't roll away due to cars in front, I want to get around to the other side and wait the 5 minutes. Their leader's response; ""First of all, we're not girls. We're women, and we're graduate business students. Don't EVER call us girls, you creepy old f.a.r.t.! Second, you HAVE to take us, this is a scheduled trip."" At this point, I'm getting all sorts of flashbacks to being a cop but I bite my tongue; entitled graduate business school students can be extremely annoying. My retort: ""There is nothing inappropriate about calling you girls. And in fact, you are now acting more like 19-year-old sorority girls than graduate students. I take what I do seriously. I do not take four passengers for Uber POLICY reasons; for safety and insurance requirements. Please request another Uber. Oh, and I'm also a biz school alum; class of 2002. Ask your class mates if they have met me; look me up in the alumni directory. I DO NOT appreciate being verbally abused."" Boom. At this point THEY cancel and I get the fee. Not a murmur as I roll away. 
Once before I encountered a group of MBA students who asked a couple questions about my profile and actually laughed when I said I was an alum; ""Yeah, right!"" sort of reaction, followed by ""Name two of your professors."" As if most of my professors are still there, nearly 20 years later. So I pulled over, asked for their school email (which one guy gave me) and sent him an email with my alumni email address.

It’s my last ride of the night last night and on my way to get pax phone rings. I ordinarily don’t pick up but this time I did. It’s ‘Monica’ who requested the ride.

She explains that I’m on my way to pick up ‘truck parts’ and if I deliver them to her broken down trucker there’s a $50 tip in it for me.

What the hell, it was a short distance to pick up the parts, which turned out to be two small boxes from a freight liner parts place, and the trucker was a six mile trip from there. Two miles past an exit on 95 south as described by ‘pax’ She entered a nearby address for the app.

So I find the truck and pull off on 95, hand off the parts to the trucker, apparently he’s been broken down awhile. Dude is without food and asks if I’ll run him to the next exit for food and back. The ride is still active so I call and explain this to Monica and she ups the tip another 10 to get the man some food. Fine with me, found a Wendy’s and backtracked down 95 to the truck.

I get the bag of food to the lobby and get a text to bring it up to their room on the 12th floor...

It’s 2 huge bags of probably an $80-$100 order from a mid range restaurant.

Miller’s ale house.


And I call le paxhole.


“We’re not coming down for it you need to bring it up”


I show the valet the response...


“No... for one you can’t leave your car parked for the 15-20 minutes to get up there and back and we just arnt going to let an unregistered person go through the hotel. They are going to have to come get it.
Just leave it with me.

“The valet isn’t going to let me in the hotel. Your going to have to come to the lobby sorry”


“This is unacceptable we arnt paying for it and I’m going to tell them you never arrived and we arn’t paying for it”

Whoah whoah WHOAH.... hold it a second....

I tell the valet that there’s drama and show him the text chain.


I called grub hub support and... they sent that text chain through the app....

I know this is going to be a problem...

I talked to The support guy about the issue, and he says the customer was hell bent on denying I arrived with the food while I’m still at the lobby laughing my ass off... trying to get them agree to come down... Rather than get Some bs drama from them over not getting their order after leaving it with the front desk and having them NEVER come down to get it. I wanted them to just tell me that they are going to get it from the lobby. That’s all I was asking for.


After like 5 minutes of waiting I get a call back from support.

“Destroy the food. They don’t trust you didn’t tamper with it... your good”

“I haven’t seen anyone come down to the lobby and there’s restaurant seals on the bags”


“Your good, enjoy destroying it sir”


I look at the valet...


“You eat lunch yet bro? You earned it”


Yep I give this giant prick who has been a pain in my furry behind for years an entire entree. I also give out drinks to the rest of the hotel lobby staff a couple of drinks each (6 cups of flat Diet Coke? I’m not losing much there)

post-6481482,MondayMan,"Aug 28, 2020 at 10:09 AM","Names have been changed in this story so I don’t disappear.

I’ll start with some background information. When I first moved to New Jersey, it wasn’t long before a guy who called himself Paul from Brooklyn stopped me in the parking lot of my workplace to welcome me to the area and to tell me who I should meet. He told me several names of people who owned businesses in the area. He said, “When the lights go out, these are the guys with the generators.” (Later I googled some of the names and found several old New York Times articles about their suspected involvement in mob hits, bribing judges, etc.) Then finally he told me the name of an Italian restaurant where the higher-ups meet for dinner every Thursday night. Which takes us to last night, a Thursday.

I don’t usually drive in the evening, but Uber suckered me into it with a quest. If I gave four more rides for the week I’d get a $35 bonus, and that seemed (meh) ok, so out I went after my kids’ bedtime.

After three rides, my fourth and final ping of the night came from “Frankie” at the Italian restaurant that Paul from Brooklyn told me about. I pulled up and saw two men and a woman at the corner. I stopped right behind a Rolls Royce, unlocked my doors, and confirmed the name. One of the men tried to get in the front seat, but I asked him to ride in the back because of the covid regulations. They weren’t excited about cramming three-wide into the back seat of my compact car, but they said they were only going three blocks so they’d do it.

Me (joking): “Is that your Rolls Royce?”

Frankie: “Yeah, I just had a few too many so I’m gonna leave it here for the night.”

Other guy: “Wanna race?”

Me: “Ha ha. Do you guys live around here?”

Frankie: “Don’t ask questions, just drive.”

Me: “Ha ha, ok.”

Me: “How is that restaurant? Sorry, I know that’s another question.”

Frankie: silence

Me, dropping them off: “Ok, nice meeting you guys. Sorry again for the close quarters in the back seat. Have a good night.”

No tip. But I got my $35 quest bonus and went home, and I don’t think I was followed.

post-6532904,The Gift of Fish,"Sep 24, 2020 at 6:46 PM","In California Uber currently tells drivers at ping time the estimated value of each fare. Early this morning I received a 3.1x surge ping that Uber valued at $1,193 - $1,457, with a pickup in Redwood City CA and destination Los Angeles, 350 miles away.




I accepted the ping, assuming that that pax was a numpty who had entered an incorrect destination. I planned to arrive at the pickup and have the pax enter the correct destination, preserving the 3.1x surge for the ride. I set off for the pickup, which was 10 minutes away.

Around 5 minutes after I accepted the ping, I got a message from the account holder. She said that I would be picking up John and taking him to LA. I texted back, asking her if she was aware that the fare would be around $1,400 and that it was a 3.1x surge. She replied that when she booked the ride yesterday, her Uber app had given her an estimate of between $350 - $500. I told her again that if her friend took the ride, the fare would be around $1,400. She replied that the friend must get to LA, that I should pick him up and do the ride, and that if Uber charged her that amount then she would fight it with Uber.

So, sports fans, there was a decision to make. The three options were:

a) Shuffle the pax. Because of the distance I drove to the pickup, the no show fee would have been around 9 bucks.

Advantage: It would be 9 bucks.

Disadvantage: It would be 9 bucks.

b) Do the ride. For any noob drivers playing along at home, this ride request raised red flags. The first was that the account holder would not be travelling, therefore there would be no gps record of any pax travelling with me. Second, it would have been an extremely high value fare and subject to Uber's ""review process"". I would not be paid the fare unless and until Uber approved payment to me. Third, the account holder had already confirmed that if she got billed $1,400, which she indeed would be, she would fight the fare with Uber.

Advantage: If paid out by Uber, this would be an enormous fare. I had just bought 10 no-commission pings for $7 from Uber, so I would keep the entire amount paid by the pax, less $3 for the ride fee.

Disadvantage: Uber has a track record of refusing to pay large fares. I would inevitably have to fight Uber to get paid. I would be risking driving 700 miles / 11 hours round trip for no pay and could also be out of pocket $60 for gas.

c) Offer the pax a cash up-front deal.

Advantage: Uber would be cut out of the deal, therefore no risk of being screwed over by Uber and not getting paid.

Disadvantage: The amount that the pax would likely agree to would be less than $1,400.

I can tell you that I did not choose option b. With those three red flags, setting off down the highway and hoping for the best would be, like watching granny porn, something that you just don't do.

So folks, what would you have done?",2020

1) A grocery pick-up in a Chinese supermarket. It looks like knowing the Chinese language is a prerequisite for delivery drivers now.

2) We all know Walmart pick-up is never worth the effort. Groceries pick up is not the case. There was a $4 bonus per delivery and the first customer left me a $4 tip. Walmart staff brings the items to your car but you need to bring every bag to the customer's door. If your customer lives in an apartment complex then you are @@ed (which I was @@ed by the 2nd delivery + no tip).

3) As the message indicates, the customer planned the delivery too early for her friend. Normally I would not have waited particularly with the famous line ""I will tip you later"".

post-6565515,MadTownUberD,"Oct 12, 2020 at 7:36 AM","About half an hour ago I pulled into a McDonald's across from the east Towne mall in Madison, an area with a sharp increase in panhandling recently. I stopped in to use the bathroom, then planned to get breakfast at the drive thru vs. at the counter due to spiking COVID cases.

As I exited the building, a middle aged man was screaming obscenities at a car that was pulling around to the drive thru. He asked me if I worked there, perhaps because my outfit today looks somewhat like that of a McDonald's employee in the dark, to which I answered ""no dude"". He mocked me, then continued his cell phone conversation.

I went through the drive thru and got my breakfast. The car he had screamed at was right in front of me. Dashcam ready, I was preparing myself mentally to witness a fight. After I got my food, I pulled into a parking spot, windows cracked, to eat my food and wait for a ping. The guy was still there so I locked my doors.

He started to explain himself. I asked why he had screamed at the car, and he said the driver had swerved deliberately to hit a cat. He said he was a father of four, a school teacher, and a cat lover. ""Not everyone is a panhandler, not everyone is a criminal"", he went on. He mentioned something about staying in Sun Prairie and that he'd give me $12 for gas money because he can't afford a taxi. Apparently he was asking for a ride, which I verbally questioned and he confirmed. Something about needing a jump and calling the police....I didn't quite follow. ""Imagine yourself in my situation"", he said.

I briefly considered this proposition, at least transporting him for free (for insurance reasons), then realized everything that could go wrong...most notably contracting the 'Rona. I simply have too much to lose, even if his motives were pure. There was too much that didn't add up. If he's a school teacher, why does he need help? Why was he near east Towne, several miles from Sun Prairie? Why would he offer me $12? If he had a phone, why didn't he request an Uber?

He seemed mentally unstable and his story didn't make sense. I told him ""I can't do it"" and he said ""thanks anyway"" as I pulled out of the parking lot. This sounded eerily like the ""God bless you anyway"" that some panhandlers say to me when I refuse them. Yes, I am a heartless monster.

So my question to you is: is this a new type of scam? I've been hearing the one about ""needing gas money to see my family in Milwaukee/Chicago"" for years, but a scheme in which the person offers ME money?!?!",2020
post-6569394,FLKeys,"Oct 14, 2020 at 1:34 PM","Yesterday evening I get a ping at a local resort, pull up and see six people standing in a group. One walks up to may car and says they ordered 2 cars can I wait a minute for the other driver to show up se they can see who will fit where. I say sure are you Jeff? He says no I am Gary, Jeff is right here. I'm like okay this car is for Jeff so Jeff will need to at least be one of the people that ride in my car. They ask why and I explain that in the past I have had negative experiences when there are multiple drivers and the person ordering the ride does not ride with me. 

The other driver shows up and Jeff and Gary both get in my car with someone else and the other driver gets the 3 other people. We are going to a restaurant about 5 miles away. The other driver rips out around me and pulls out on to the highway. I follow, much slower. We have to head South and make a U-Turn to go North.

I see the other drivers blinker come on and say hope he is not turning there, there is a no U-turn sign and a state trooper sitting right there. Sure enough he make a U-Turn and before he is even all the way around the trooper turns on his lights and goes after him. They ask me to pull over so I do. I say this is exactly why I want the person ordering the ride to be in my car, if you were in that car you would most likely down rate the ride even though I did not make the illegal U-Turn. After sitting a few minutes and a phone call to the other car they had me continue to the restaurant. 

I drop them off and head back to my staging area and get a ping from Gary. Pick-up is, you guessed it, side of the road where the other driver was pulled over. Get there and the other 3 are standing behind the state trooper car waiting for me. I pick them up and take them to the restaurant.

About 20 minutes latter I drive by the resort for another pick-up and the other Uber Driver was still sitting there with the state trooper. Guess it was a bad night for him.",2020

Got a ping from the airport arrivals ... about 20 minutes away. That has never happened. Whatever, highway miles, I accepted. 

Haven't picked up anyone at the airport in at over six months, learned my lesson not to bother with the queue long before the pandemic. 

There are multiple zones for commercial pickups, two for RS that are seperate by a good distance. This other Uber driver was to my left, cones were blocking me from getting to the RS #2 location. 

He stops next to me (I can't go forward), honks his horn, and says ""that's not the Uber spot"". 

""Yeah, thanks, got it - there are cones in front of me"".. 

He pulls forward, I park in the correct spot, and hop out to load luggage. 

As I am confirming the pax, I turn around and there he is! 

""Just so you know, there is a $50 fine for picking up passengers at the wrong place"" - place is deserted and I picked up my pax properly. 

Three business guys in their 30s, as the other driver pulls off one of them says ""jesus, what an ant! Look at his tags!"" 

Without doxing the guy, his tags were ""Uber"" followed by a letter or two. And, with all of that, he wasn't wearing a mask.

There were cars lined up, I was actually just sitting there for 15 seconds, waiting for them to give me an opening to turn into...

...picture looks like I might have just pulled in front of that car, but that is not the case. The car turned on to that road and ran into my sitting car.

I don't blame him totally....not a lot of reaction time but i 'think' he was gunning it turning onto the road....never saw him so not sure.

I don't think I can win this in court and get it overturned, so I'm just going to pay the $185.

post-6543477,FLKeys,"Sep 30, 2020 at 10:35 AM","First off surges in my area are extremely rare. Since the sticky surge started I have never received a surge ride that started in a surge zone. All rides started well after the surge is off the map and I only get the sticky amount. Side note this past New Years Eve resulted in no Surge rides do to driver saturation.

Last night after I drop a PAX off I find myself sitting in a Surge zone with $1.50 sticky. I don't typically drive around looking for work so I park and sit right in the middle of the zone. After about 10 minutes it jumps up to a $6.25 surge. Within a minute I get a ping, a comfort ride. I accept, it is very close by less that 1/2 a mile, still in the surge area on the map. Thinking to myself cool this is the first ping I ever got that is in a surge zone since they started the sticky surge.

I get there and at that point I notice it is a scheduled trip and I'm thinking damn I'm not going to get the surge.

Do the trip, and I immediately look to see what the PAX paid and what I got paid for the surge.

PAX paid regular price plus they had a $10.00 off promotion. They ended up paying $16.40. If I try to book the same trip right now with no surge it is within $1 of what they paid before the coupon. So they did not pay any surge.

I got paid $31.66 for the trip including a $5 tip. Uber lost $16.26 on this trip. My Surge portion was $15.38 clearly more than the $6.25 surge I had on the app.

So I got paid more than the sticky amount on a scheduled ride. I was surprised to see this after reading so many threads saying riders paid surge and drivers did not get any extra. Also the rider did not pay any surge so really confused that I got paid above the $6.25 surge.

Also within a few seconds of me accepted the ping the surge map that I had up on my tablet immediately went away. I keep my tablet open with Uber on it to use as a reference. I can see surge while on a trip, I can see if a PAX left a tip before I rate, etc.",2020

post-6528735,NotYetADriver,"Sep 22, 2020 at 2:08 PM","Last night I needed a 10 mile ride in Fort Lauderdale.

After putting in the information, the quote came back at $29.75.
I was ready to confirm the ride but my Visa card had expired and so I had to re enter my new CC and information.

This time the Fare came back as $66.00. (For a 10 mile ride) 
Underneath the quote it said (fares may vary significantly during peak or busy times) even though a moment earlier it did not.
The area was a ghost town. Only a few cars here and there.
Obviously I declined.
Uber probably desperately needed the money, but I'm not willing to be their sucker. They lost the entire fare.

Frustrated with the absurdity of Uber, I called YellowCab

It was a much quicker online experience and easier process on my phone and the quote for the same ride was $31.75 which I accepted.
In 10 minutes the Prius arrived and the driver was very nice.
I wasn't even asked about payment and no card or cash was necessary to get into the cab.
Super cool guy.

I got home, payed the driver and tipped him $10.00

Based on this, I will probably call YellowCab first from now on.
Anyone who accepts a 10 mile ride for nearly $70 is crazy. And any company who would try that is a failure, if not a thief IMO.
It was not a ""peak"" time and I'm sure many drivers could have used that fare....but Uber's greed cost everyone involved with Uber.
I wonder how many times per day this happens?

Uber has lost their way and I can't see their business model lasting much longer. They lost California and will likely lose NY soon.
Especially when taking a Yellow Cab is less expensive and just as good if not better service.

Pickup up pax in Chicago wealthy North Shore and drove him downtown. He looked like he was in his late twenties. We started by talking about young people having a hard time finding work in general. Then he suddenly started up with blaming everything on Trump. I agreed with him Trump has character flaws. He kept going off about how Trump is ruining the country and turning us into a third world nation. I often have my guard up completely and walk/talk softly when it comes to politics with pax. So I tried to be as gentle as possible.

I did agree with him that our country has problems, but we are a great and wonderful nation. He answered back something like, ""No, we are a stupid country with stupid people who elected Trump as our president"", and then said something that somehow irritated me. He said something like, """". And then, """".

I very carefully pointed out that the U.S. still has the highest immigration by far, so there must be at least some people who like to come here. And I did point out to him in a respectful way that if he is going to move into another country he has to have money/and or skills. I did ask him what he did for work, and he said he was out of work now, but his last job was retail in Old Orchard Shopping Center. And he did say he lives with his parents and has little money.

He said that under Trump the U.S. has lost its status in the world, and started demeaning so many things. I nicely and kindly pointed out that the U.S. is still leading the world in many areas like high technology (Silicon Valley), educational institutions like the Ivy League, great movies, sports, and the military. He countered a story that I am not right about the military, like the Air Force. He said when he went to Israel, he talked to the Israeli Air Force and said their Air Force was vastly superior to that of the U.S.

So, I looked at him in the rear view mirror, and asked, ""If there was an plane battle with ALL planes, would you take the U.S. Air Force or the Israeli Air Force? (I just wanted to see what he would say...I know such a thing would never happen between two friendly nations)"" And then he replied that, ""No doubt the Israeli Air Force"". I pointed out to him that the U.S. Air Force is probably ten times larger (I didn't know off the top of my head). He responded back, ""But the Israeli Air Force pilots are much better trained."" To which I replied, ""Maybe, I have no idea, but the U.S. Air Force is not some third world country trained group, and the U.S. probably has hundreds of thousand of planes vs. tens of thousands of planes for Israel"".

At this point, I was more curious that someone could be illogical. So I pressed a tiny bit more... I asked him, ""Then do you think that in the middle of the Pacific, if there was an air battle, then say 30,000 Israeli pilots could take down say 300,000 U.S. Air Force pilots?"" (I know that such a battle would NEVER occur because the U.S. and Israel are close friends, but I asked just for a case example). I waited for it... and he answered, ""No doubt, I'd bet on quality over quantity any day"". So concluded with saying on the subject, ""Sir, you may be right that quality is better... all things being equal, but quantity DOES matter. In an air battle over the ocean, there are not many places to hide except the clouds"". (I told him that I have no doubt that Israel has an incredibly trained Air Force).

The subject came back again to Trump, and I wanted to make sure at this point that I didn't upset up, because I really don't like to argue with pax. When he said that under Obama the economy surged and under Trump the GDP was negative, and now plunged... I very nicely pointed out the facts. I told him that GDP growth was actually positive in every year Trump was in office, and the negative GDP numbers was due to Covid. I just gently told him that he has valid criticisms about Trump and told him he should tell all his friends to vote, As we came towards his destination, I steered the conversation into a friendly one about the Chicago Bulls.

I don't know about you guys, but whenever pax say something TOTALLY illogical, I like to carefully steer their logic in the right direction WITHOUT upsetting them. I think this is hard to do, and maybe it is a lot easier to keep quiet and just nod silently. But sometimes driving for a while can get boring. And when a pax says something so obviously wrong, I'll point to their mistakes. In this case, I got slightly annoyed and had to check myself when the pax trashed the U.S. the country and its citizens. I wondered if he hates it so much, he should leave. A lot of people would like to come here, in spite of all America's flaws...",2020
post-6517039,UberFizzle,"Sep 16, 2020 at 5:07 AM","I responded to a request that was a few minutes out of my way, but I didn't mind [much]. It was a gated community, but the pin drop was just outside the gates, so I waited there. I messaged that I was there (just in case the pin drop was a mistake), and the passenger responds, asking if I can wait there. He doesn't say when he'll be out. Weird, but whatever, I'll wait for 5 minutes.

5 minutes go by, no one in sight, so I no-show the guy. Sure enough, as soon as I turn around to leave, some dude sprints out of the security office and comes running toward my car as I drive away. I was parked right in front of the office the entire time, within direct view, which tells me he knew I was there, and just didn't bother to come out. I think he just assumed I would wait for as long as he took. What a mistake on his part.

As I drove away, he's screaming for me to stop, and my passenger side window was slightly rolled down enough to where I could loudly say ""Nope"", and drove off. Even as I continued to drive away, he was literally screaming for me to stop, and even asks if I'm an Uber, but at this point, he's to my back, and I'm almost at the stop light to turn. In situations like this, I don't slow my exit because people can be very crazy, especially when upset. He yelled some profanities, I took that right turn at the light, and drove off. I usually have very little sympathy for people who show such blatant lack of respect for others' time.

Seconds later, as I'm driving away, I get a ping from the same guy. I decline, and continue on my way. It's not like I'm the only Uber around, so he can just wait for another driver, and hopefully show a little more respect for that driver's time. Interesting thing was his rating was a 4.98. Just goes to show that even those with high ratings can still show very little care for others' time.",2020

I was out in the Boondocks, Hemet, Ca. Ping to Banning, about 15 miles to pickup, but its moving toward home (DF on). It's a Holiday Inn Express. I arrive, he texts, ""Be right there"" .

Ok, you already know where this is going, right? But, it's a scheduled trip (you've arrived 3 minutes early. We will pay you for the extra wait time), and the trip is moving me home.

The texts are:
Be right there
Don't leave
I'll tip you

So I chill. At 5 minutes, he texts again

Sorry
I'm coming

At 7 minutes, the ""Qualify for cancel fee"" comes up. This is a true dilemma for me. I'm 20 miles from home, and this yahoo will pay for it. On the other hand, he's a pain in the donkey.

I text him

""How much longer? I have another trip waiting.""

Now, I figure this might do it. But he replies:

Another 3-4 minutes.

I text,""sorry, gotta go"".

What's strange, I was in the area another 20 minutes, running short trips, and he never requested again.

post-6508859,Ozzyoz,"Sep 11, 2020 at 3:50 PM","Am I losing my mind or is this a Glitch in the Matrix? Stuff I witnessed in Uber as a driver is beyond Coincidence. I have been doing IT since 2017 and I mainly drive weekends. At my IT job I work with a handful of people that I support with tech and app issues. There were 3 people that I believe I had a Glitch in The Matrix (What are the odds of that moment). All 3 of these people I managed at one point help with a tech issue or setup a new work laptop for.

The first I also happen to somehow get paired with in Uber, her friends and herself were downtown when I got the ping and she was surprised she got me as her driver. She is one I also usually help stuff with periodically at the IT job and she is my co-worker there. 

2nd person I picked up her friends and herself too at a southern city that is 30+ minutes away from where we work. I am rarely at this city as it is farther away from where I live in. She was also my co-worker and I assisted her numerous times.

Third person is a man and I picked him up from his house and took him to airport. He is also my co-worker who I interacted with at IT job numerous times.


It doesn't end there.


In Uber I picked up exactly the same group of people. A husband and his wife, and a short guy who makes funny jokes who I clearly 100% remember driving the previous year and here is the shocker, both the precious and current year I took them to same concert at Surly and they happened to request when I was the only driver near them, Uber only pairs by closest driver to you. I happened to be in Golden Valley again and near them when they requested so it is as if they had some higher self psychic ability to know I was nearby and they requested me at just the right time.


Then there is a Doctor who told me she is Jewish and she is rich too, she owns a Multi-Million dollar house. And every-time I am passing by i394 and right before I miss her exit, she just happens to ping me as if some higher self in her has psychic ability and knows exactly when to request to get me when her subconscious knows I am nearby and gives her idea to ping me. She got mw 4 different times. 

And we are talking about a city of 5 Million people here with at least 10,000+ Uber drivers and even more Lyft drivers.

It doesn't end there. There was 1 day where I had Mike, Michael passengers back to back for about 4 hours, what are the odds of seeing Mike or Michael back to back non-stop.

Then there was a day where I drove a Vikings Football player from airport and as a gift he gave me nice expensive headphones then that same evening I also happen to drive another important person. A Professional Hockey player for VanCouver who I drove to Hotel so he can stay there for his upcoming game next day and he was a rich guy too. I am like how do I a regular Uber manage to drive Rich sports people?

Then there are about 3 teens in a nearby city who are college kids and they somehow request exactly perfect timing to get me on random times and days, so what are the odds of that? I drove them about 5 times on various random hours and days when I arrived near wherever new location they were. That should not have happened as there are many other drivers that would be closer to them than I am.",2020

For the first episode, I will be roadtripping for a week with a trucker friend of mine to show what it’s really like to transport things right now. Jeff also has a truly inspirational life story.

If you want to share your story or have an a friend who might have something interesting to say, please share. I am especially interested in hearing about impact of COVID on your work (good and bad), challenges you face as drivers, and of course stories, stories, and more stories that can inspire other people.

post-6514157,Young Kim,"Sep 14, 2020 at 6:19 PM","Had a pax who was 24 years old. Picked him up from downtown and brought him to Western Springs, IL. I often ask what is a person's most defining moment in their lives (once I developed a warm, kind, friendly, and gentle rapport). Unfortunately, it was not a happy one. He told me the both his parents died last year suddenly from a car accident. He told me that happened on the expressway, and someone had rear ended them and the car crashed into the median. He had one brother, who lives out of town. He said that while of course he was devastated, he was still in a sort of denial. Interestingly, he said that he can't get himself to tell anyone because he said he said that he doesn't want pity. But...telling me (a person with no connection at present or in the future) feels OK to him. 

When people ask him, he still cannot get himself to tell them that both his parents are gone. He said he hasn't even sold their cars yet. He had previously lived with his parents. When we got to his home, it was a nice house, and I saw two newer model cars in the driveway (one was a BMW). He seemed OK and had a good head on his shoulders. He now lives completely alone... I wished him well, and hoped all will work out for him. I reflected on this, and thought how quickly a person's life can change in an instant.

post-6500420,The Gift of Fish,"Sep 7, 2020 at 12:22 AM","Inspired by a recent post by , I thought we should share the shuffle, or shuffles, that were the most satisfying that we have had. Mine is:

A French man requests from a restaurant in downtown SF. Immediately outside the restaurant is a bus stop, so I pull up to wait on the other side of the road about 4 cars away. Pierre emerges from the restaurant with two children of about 3 and 5 years of age and, of course, stops on the curb at the bus stop. Pierre starts to look at his phone, then he looks in the direction I am sitting, then in the opposite direction, and then back to his phone again. I decide to phone him.

- ""Alo?""
- ""Hello. I cannot pick you up from where you are standing because it is a bus stop""
- ""Why can't you pick me up from a bus stop?""
- ""Because I am not driving a bus""
- ""What makes you think this is a bus stop?""
- ""The words Bus Stop painted on the road 6 feet away from you""
- ""This is not a bus stop""
- ""Please turn to your right and walk 30 feet. I will pick you up there""
- ""I have children. I cannot go""
- ""I see that your children are equipped with legs""
- ""What?""
- ""Your children have legs. They can walk 30 feet""
- ""No. Cancel the ride""
- ""No""

This back-and-forth continued as the timer counted closer to 5:00. Pierre ended the call as he flagged down a taxi. He grinned stupidly at me as he passed me in his cab, apparently quite pleased with himself that he had managed to hail one. I grinned back at him as I pressed the button to take the $5.00 fee from his account. It was not the most highly paid shuffle I've had, but it was the most satisfying.",2020

The first few minutes she's rambling incoherently but she was cordial enough when I handed her my Amazon special ""just in case"" vomit bag. After about 5 minutes she asks ""you picking up what I'm putting down?"" To which I respond ""to be honest you are a little hard to follow right now."" I had her on auto-tuneout, a skill mastered early on in my marriage. Then out of nowhere she blurts out ""I'm a lesbian but I like D***"".

1) I need to find a dark place to park STAT!
2) I'm married
3) Should I leave the meter running? (obviously a yes). I mean, how often do you get paid for this.
4) How good would it really be if she's playing for the other team?

I weigh my options while still hoping she doesn't vomit in my car. She touches my elbow (caresses?). I think, ""that's not it honey."" Any woman who has made this offer holds a special place in my heart and I appreciate the gesture. I opt for the ""good husband"" route and tell her I'm happily married.

post-6506836,Young Kim,"Sep 10, 2020 at 2:21 PM","I was driving with a pax going north on Ridge Rd in Evanston, IL. It was dark at nighttime. I was driving a few miles under the speed limit (my guess is I was going around 30 miles her hour). Suddenly, I saw a family of raccoons dart out between parked cars from my right side. I first saw them in just a flash, but then it seemed to happened in slow motion, as I slammed on the brakes hard. My passenger was quite startled. His body hit the back of the seat. I thought I heard a noise... I stopped. We told ourselves that I probably avoid them, and they were ok. So I proceeded to go to his destination (I did not get out of the car after I braked). The ride lasted a few more minutes. He told me that he saw the family of raccoons as well dart out between the cars, and there was nothing at all I could have done differently. I apologized to him because of the sudden stop. He responded that had I NOT stopped so suddenly, then he would have thought there was something wrong with me, so that made me feel better. (Physically, he was just fine).

I was really bothered by this, so after I dropped him off, I retraced my path. After several minutes, I believed I was at the right place. I didn't see anything at first, but after exploring the area, I did see a raccoon lying on its side. Likely it was the same raccoon, but I wanted to believe it was not the raccoon that darted in front of me. All these years I have been driving for Uber, I never hit an animal. Come to think of it, I don't think I have ever hit even a squirrel in my entire life. This was the first animal I ever hit. (I am STILL hoping that the animal I saw was indeed NOT one of the raccoons in the family that darted in front of me). Anyhow, I was really bummed out, and felt pretty bad.

And then the vomiting started... I've had many pax vomit before, but this one was particularly vulgar. Five minutes of heavy vomiting on the street and sidewalk. It was sort of funny when a couple of other cars saw him when cars stopped at a traffic light, and they were yelling out to him sort of laughing. He kept on apologizing to me over and over, and I told him it was fine and ""we've all been there, don't worry"".

He was hunched over for a while looking dizzy, and I was afraid this may turn into an ""Uber Ambulance"" ride... I knew he lost a lot of fluid, because his was a ""projectile vomiting"" followed by ""dry heaving"" (when it gets so awful that in the last few nothing comes out). I tried not to look but when I checked on him, it was a sight to see. It was all over the street and sidewalk and there was  hanging out of his mouth. From experience, I have a ""vomit kit"". That is: 1) paper towels, 2) vomit bag (if he gets sick again), 3) breath mints, 4) water bottles, and 5) a vitamin tablet and aspirin. I threw a jug of a gallon water container onto the vomit to disperse it, and then I gave out all the items and he was extremely grateful... (he was white as a sheet) but we continued the 12 minute ride that ended at Jefferson Park train station. (Naturally the paper towels stayed out of my car)

I made certain that there was no vomit on the back of his clothes before he came back in my car, but I knew some had to be on the front of his clothes... because he smelled wretched (smelled of death, really it was THAT bad). After the doors closed, all the windows came down. I tried not to gag myself. His was a type of vomit that had a terrible acid like scent (very common I guess). So I breathed through my mouth. After he left, I did inspect his seat and there was no visible vomit, but the terrible scent lingered. I have always 3 full cans of air freshener, so I made sure I spray bombed his seat and the back completely. Today, it doesn't seem to smell, and I found he tipped me $4 and change on the app.",2020

post-6500473,UberChiefPIT,"Sep 7, 2020 at 1:08 AM","Wondering if anyone else experiences this sort of thing, as it's a first time for me.

I was trying to stay close to home while finishing up a huge, 70-trip weekend bonus quest late tonight. I'm live 30 minutes from the actual surge areas in my market (Pittsburgh), so most drivers aren't hanging out this area (neither do I under normal circumstances, too). But it was 9pm on a Sunday night and I needed 5 more trips to nail that big bonus.

It's so secluded and desolate in this county, all the Mom n' Pop shops close up at 6pm here. Leaving the big chains to cover the food orders 'til 10 or 11pm.

So ya, it's 9pm and ping: $22.01 w/ included tip. 14 minute trip. Banged it out, and as I slid the delivery button, next ping: $22.01.

And the next: $18. And the next: $22. And the next, $16.

So when I say I ""played cleanup"", all these places I showed up to had these orders waiting for a very long time (2 hours on one of them) for a driver. No drivers = no deliveries.

The orders sat for so long, they capped out the $15.00 delivery payment from Uber, and the rest was tips, etc.

I'm considering doing this regularly from now on. Sit at home on Sunday evenings and go online at 9pm to close out the ballgame for 5-6 orders ~$22 each.",2020
post-6489961,Kurt Halfyard,"Sep 1, 2020 at 3:18 PM","This question was posed in a rather unfortunate and ugly way way earlier, but I am interested in having this conversation in a serious, and thoughful way (No, Seriously!)

Ignoring the 'punching down' racism and framing of this former query (it's edited above, and I'm not linking to the closed thread. But I'll bite.

Why Do I Drive when I do NOT NEED the Money?

For one, I have a hyper efficient vehicle (EV), so maintenence and fuel costs are minimal, even as mileage is racked up on my vehicle (which doubles as our family car).
For another, I have a mild case of insomnia (A 'Night Owl' by nature) and used to channel the late hours watching, reading, and writing. There is precious little income in it, particularly FILM-writing, but it allowed me to travel the festival circuit for a while as an accredited film critic. After nearly 20 years of obsessive movie watching and 10 years of freelancing, podcasting, and generally other contributions 'for the love of cinema' I figured I would get my eyes off the screen, and onto humanity. Yea, in part, I'm in it for the masochism () I'm not a tourist though, I have logged a serious number of rides on both platforms, have participated on the LYFT Driver Advisory Council (LDAC) and tangled with the late-night bar crowd often, and occationally the commuter rush.

There is no greater 'STEW' of humanity than RideHail Pax, outside of public transit Pax (and I wasn't becoming a bus driver, the dayjob has to pay the bills!) I only do people though, not interested in shucking around food or Amazon packages

Flexibility of the Gig-Apps, and low barrier to entry allows for more 'utilization of a depreciating asset,' and the tax write-offs (when stacked against my Professional Day Job) are pretty good. Ride hail + Dayjob brings my income into 6 figures, whereas DayJob alone is close but no cigar. So yea, the pennies help.

For all it's bullshit, and mind-games, and entitled pax, I still kinda like doing it. The power to 'turn it off forever' on a whim is seductive

post-6493222,MyJessicaLS430,"Sep 3, 2020 at 1:25 AM","Waiting for the first ping at home, Postmate sent me a burger delivery (not McDonald / 5 guys). The area where the customer works is not where you will find decent orders or rides but it is just a few miles away from Cheesecake Factory. What's better than getting paid to drive for lunch? Shocked by seeing 10 cheeseburgers, I contacted support to verify the order. To my surprise, they found me an agent almost in no time. After putting me on hold for ~2 mins, he confirmed that the order was accurate. Such level of competence is likely non-existent in Uber. For entertainment purposes, look at the estimate (bottom left, small font). Where can you buy 10 burgers for $8.29 in 2020 &#128558;?




After placing 2 large bags in my car, I went online on both apps setting Cheesecake Factory as the destination in hopes for fishing a ride or two. At a paltry rate of 50 cents / mile, long-hauling only makes sense when doing rideshare at the same time. My experience with the combination of Postmate and Lyft is quite positive for the 2 times that I have tried. Unfortunately, this does not apply to Uber. The pick-up location shown by the first ride request is in the correct general direction but requires back-tracking west. Needless to say, no way would I accept a 4.46. My jaw dropped when receiving the second ping. Are you kidding me Uber?? How can this ride bring me closer to Cheesecake Factory while I was only ~3 miles away??




After unloading, the customer gave me $2 cash. She wondered why it took so long before somebody accepted the delivery. All I replied was a smile. She works in an area where people are cheap as dirt (Westchase in Houston, TX). More importantly, it was a 15-mile delivery which is guaranteed to be a money losing drive.

On Friday evening, a man from an upscale neighbourhood has made a $150 order from a sushi bar. After he thanked me, he asked if I wanted a bottle of wine from his surplus. Since alcohol is never my cup of tea, I respectfully decline and was told to wait. A few minutes later, he returned with a pack of frozen sirloin stripes and giant scallops. He explained that his fridge was almost to the full capacity because of the obsession of his wife to fill the trunk every time they shop. Does he always trip drivers like that? Actually I have to thank him for the awesome sirloin! Not much effort is needed because the stripes were already half-cooked. What you need is to pan-fry them to your preference. Amazing enough, a manager from a seafood kitchen where I have picked up food from multiple times gave me 2 crabcakes. Contrary to what you may expect, there were only tiny shreds of crab meat. Anyway not in the position to complain because they don't cost me a dime. What do they taste like? Honestly they do not taste any different from croquettes.




Before I forget, not sure if I was encouraged to also take the food from this customer on Saturday. Look at the floor mat of this apartment.

post-6493757,_Tron_,"Sep 3, 2020 at 12:31 PM","Tron reporting in from an undisclosed location. I remain evacuated from home base due to a smoke allergy. Found a relatively smoke-free hideout within the state. Bivouacked at a cheap motel. Ubering and Lyfting daily to pay travel expenses. The area has a reasonable amount of rideshare demand and is slightly underserved, enabling a reasonable gross of $1700 last week.

Was driving the day U/L threatened to shut down rideshare rather than obey the judge's order to convert drivers to employees. What a mess, and what terrible timing. I'm sure this has been discussed ad infinitum, but the drama of that day is likely the best PR move U/L could have made to promote California's proposition 22, which is slated for a November vote. Many passengers had been informed ride sharing was shutting down at midnight and were not happy. As with smartphones and Air B&B's, many can't live without Uber.

I am reluctantly suggesting to my pax to vote YES on prop 22. Damn it.

Because of the number of trips I'm taking the Uber pax stories are piling up. Learning to 1-star pax who cheat with their masks by slipping them down during the trip when they think I'm not looking. Love it that Lyft will not make a match in the future if you issue the pax 3 stars or less. Not sure about Uber.

So here is a postcard&#8230; One memorable trip was with Eva. She did not even get in the car, but I remember the ride. Upon arriving at the pickup she ran up to the car from a lively courtyard, a large and apologetic smile on her face. She was a goddess. Light in complexion and light on her feet. The kind of woman a man would lasso the moon for.

Turns out she had called a car for her two drunk male party guests. Figures. But Eva had played it respectfully by first coming out to the car and asking permission for her two inebriated friends to be driven home. She spent a minute or two breaking down the situation, insisting that her men were not so far gone as to get sick on the trip. That assertion, plus Eva's sincere effort to make everyone happy, was enough to gain my acquiescence. And although I was memorized by her magical gaze, I maintained enough presence of mind to reserve the right to refuse service once the two tipsy curmudgeons came in to view.

Eva, smiling and gushing thank you's, turned and ran to fetch the soon to be passengers. At about 10 feet from the car I spoke the words ""Eva the Diva"" in a normal tone of voice. She heard the utterance, stopped momentarily, did a 180 twirl, smiled and curtseyed before continuing.  couldn't help but smile.

The ogars appeared, struggled with their masks for a moment, and poured themselves into the car. Once seatbelts had been fastened we were off. It turned out that the men had standing in the community. Both Eva and one of the men had quietly tipped me off that I was driving the D.A for the city of _____ home. Not the assistant D.A.,  D.A. The gentleman tipping me off to that fact had an interest in a couple of the most renowned restaurants in the locale I am servicing. None the less they both behaved like beligerant high school kids on the drive. Ha ha. At one point restaurant man offered me as much as $100 to allow him to remove his mask. I repeatedly declined, and both men let out an astonished gasp when they realized I could not be bought.

The two men were being dropped at differing destinations. They argued about who was going to give the driver a cash tip. In the end neither did. Eva had warned me in her backgrounder that ""They're a**holes"". Before ending the trip I broke character and texted Eva that her guests had been delivered safe and sound, and neither of them had tipped. When I later checked the ride history a $10 tip had been added.

Eva is a classy gal. I hope to run into her again.

I don't mind long rides, the only thing I was concerned with was hoping I had enough gas without having to stop as I did not fill-up Friday night because it was so slow and I was already home waiting on rides.

We had a great conversation talking about fishing, both salt water and fresh water. Made the trip go real fast talking about a subject we both enjoy. The rider was meeting a boat owner at a Marina and was working as a mate, they were leaving on a 8 night trip from Boca Raton, FL to Key West, FL, to the Dry Tortugas, and finally to Naples, FL. They will leave the boat in Naples for routine maintenance and some time in mid October will make the same trip in reverse.

We were about 3 miles from the destination and my car was sitting at empty with an estimated 4 miles until empty on the display. Way to close for my comfort. The rider says hey do you mind if we stop at a convenience store so I can grab a couple items. I say no problem I'll just fill my tank while you run in. As I pull up to the gas pump the rider slides over from the passenger side to the driver side, he gets out and puts his credit card in the pump and says fill it up. I tell him thanks and he runs in the store. I finished filling up before he gets back in the car with 3 bags of drinks and snacks.

We get to the Marina and the rider drops me a $50 bill and thanks me for taking the long trip and making the stop at the store for him. $36.64 to fill my tank and $50 on top of it made for a very nice tip.",2020

My customer Steve called me saying that his place is difficult to find in dark. While I used to have a number of decent rides from the Memorial Villages, this is my first time to be in the area after sunset. He told me to specifically look for the mailbox 11XXX and take the driveway beside it. Can you picture yourself illuminating almost every mailbox on a poorly-lit road with a phone?

Somehow I managed to find the said mailbox. Locating his mansion has then become a lot easier (the only mansion with lights on) and he was waiting outside. As I was unloading, he asked 'can you drive me to Trader Joe to grab some beer?' He offered me $50 upfront. What a surprise. The trip, including waiting time, took about 40 minutes (one way 4 miles). On the way back, he added a brief stop at an ATM and gave me another $20. After he thanked me for the ride, here came the classic line 'I will take care of you in the app'. As of this moment, the promised tip for pizza delivery has not shown up yet.

My wallet was then inflated by his $10s and $20s. What has actually caught my attention is a $10 banknote with a completely different design.

Perhaps its value will multiply by folds when my hair turns white!

post-6460840,MyJessicaLS430,"Aug 19, 2020 at 9:51 PM","Perhaps the behaviours below are a part of TX culture. I can't help but to curse those who use the road improperly.


A considerable number of drivers do not accelerate to match highway speeds which defeats the purpose of entrance ramps. Cars therefore pile up, hence increases both the difficulty and risk for drivers behind to merge. Moreover, this is also the cause of congestion of feeder roads.


Why don't plan ahead? Whose fault it is to miss an exit? Texans, please be considerate. Use the next available exit if you miss yours. Some even have the nerve to cross multiple lanes to exit from the far left without signalling. Such selfish and reckless act can lead to a chain of accidents. Is sparing a few minutes of time really worth the consequence to bear legal and financial responsibilities for collisions and subsequent injuries, if not death?


Most highways covering the rural areas have signs that read 'no trucks on left' or 'left lane only for passing'. I always wanted to drive a tank to crush those older Prius / Corolla, U-haul vans and even 18 wheelers occupying the far left lane. Most of the time, these vehicles travel below the speed limit which is extremely annoying. A lot of sections of I-45 toward Dallas have been under construction for donkey's years, leaving only 2 lanes available. How do you feel if you were behind a vehicle on the left lane that is travelling at 60 mph in parallel with the adjacent vehicle while the limit is 75 mph?


It is already ridiculous enough on the right lane. This dangerous behaviour imposes more threat to the left lane traffic. Drivers behind may misjudge the speed and fail to slow down accordingly. What's worse, the driver behind may attempt to swerve to a pre-occupied adjacent lane. Not sure whose fault it is. The person driving below the speed limit or the driver who swerve as an evasive manoeuvre? If those people are not confident to drive the speed limit, take a bus or request a Uber. From my point of view, driving too slow is far worse than 'reasonable speeding'.


Thankfully Houston is not a city for walking or cycling but I do have a few encounters. To name a few, joggers crossing a road under orange pedestrian lights; students in a group marching at their own pace; housewives crossing multiple lanes from one side to another with kids; cyclists without a green arrow light expect oncoming traffic to yield, etc. They certainly have the freedom to die but definitely not the right to get innocent drivers involved!

For me, I vote #2 for the most despicable road usage. Please feel free to name any behaviours that your despise of. Enjoy your evening.",2020

You cant trust any Uber driver especially if you want to talk on your cellphone or what not.

Think about it. You are on your cellphone and some bad cop is listening or recording your information or worse off cloning your phone.

Its horrible especially in light of warrants not being used either anymore and all of the so called secret courts and such.

post-6470147,Young Kim,"Aug 23, 2020 at 6:29 AM","Got a ping tonight Saturday night/Sunday at 1:43 am, in Cicero, IL, pax name ""M"". She was going to 95th and the Dan Ryan in the South Side of Chicago (a 23 minute ride). She came into my car and asked what radio station I am tuned into. I told her ""easy listening"" 93.9 (what you would hear at the dentist's office). She said she loved it and asked me to turn up the volume, which I did. Then she told me she was drunk, and asked if she could drink out of her bottle... (I did inform her of the laws). Then the desultory and strange conversation started... First, she kept on asking me if I was a cop... I told her ""no"", and that it would be silly for an undercover police officer to pose as an Uber driver. She then asked me if I am going to take her to prison, upon which I again said no. (She asked this multiple times as well).

She asked all about my musical tastes, and I told her all genres, and she kept talking about her favorite music groups. Then, she started asking me about my religion when she saw my cross, and tried to make a connection. She went through how she was kicked out of Catholic school and is now a Lutheran. M told me repeatedly during the ride that she was currently running away from her husband, that he was crazy, and she needed to get away. She didn't have a job... She kept on telling me that I should never get married, and that marriage is a disaster. She then asked me my age, and I told her ""28"", and she said, ""Too bad, I am 50"". (The passenger I would say did not seem at all drunk, and I did not see or smell any bottle of liquor). 

Then she told me her pivotal moment in her life (positive) was when she found the Holy Spirit and Jesus. M then told me her lowest point... when she was 8 months pregnant with her son (who is now 22), she was intoxicated with alcohol and got into a car crash on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago... and was arrested. She had to be induced for labor and then DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) took away her son for a while. Then she told me her life story which was full of tragedy.

Then she said a few things which were so strange and somewhat funny... (During the ride, I patiently listened and tried to be a good listener). She cried momentarily because she said I was so understanding, and she that we had a deep connection. When I told her that I had an older sister by 2 years, she replied, ""Whoa! That is crazy! How did THAT happen?"". (I thought to myself silently, ""Well because my parents had intercourse two years before me""). And at the end of the ride she said she would not leave my car and kept talking, asking me if she could request me again. I had another ride stacked after, so I politely told her I must leave. M then said, ""Then please tell me a parting Bible verse that you like, which could help me"". I thought for just a moment after her difficult life, and I replied, ""Hebrew 12-10: ""They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness."" Her face lit up and she said the verse really helped her, she left the car, saying that she and I will meet again...and that she would request me again.

meaning they have a history of non payment with the cab company. And it’s a very smart idea to invoke our right to demand payment up front.



So I roll up on her place or business.


“Hang a right”


“Whoah there, I need to know where your final destination is and you need to pay me before the ride”

I wanted to go until midnight but it turns out I desperately need a new phone. My phone lost its fast-charging capability and I kept going until I got under 15%. If I can manage to get 50 rides this weekend I'll get an extra $95, but it'll be more challenging with my current phone situation.

Pretty much everyone wore masks without being asked. I only had to ask 3 people to put their mask on and they did without a fuss... even though it was pouring rain all night and I wouldn't let them in until everyone was masked. But everyone said they understood and it was no problem.

post-6448829,The Gift of Fish,"Aug 14, 2020 at 8:00 PM","Uber's offer to us in response to AB5 was:

- No more up front pricing
- Return to 75/25 or 80/20 split
- Return to multiplier surge
- Set your own surge
- Destination and trip length visible on ping screen (although declining ""too many"" pings now results in drivers being deprioritised and receiving few pings for the rest of the week)

For me all this wasn't enough. In order for me to vote for Prop 22, I would also want:

- Pay rate minimum of $1.10 per mile + 40c per minute. Set your own surge but with a minimum of 1.0x to prevent morons from ruining prices with offers to take pax at 0.5x. Suggested surge indications on the map to show where high demand is.

- Cap on the number of drivers at, say, December 2018 numbers. Active driver numbers can only go up in proportion to number of rides given year-on-year. For example, if Uber's ride figures for June 2020 are 10% higher than they were in June 2019, then Uber's total active driver count can only be increased by 10% over what it was in June 2019. This would allow the service to grow while not increasing driver saturation.

And that's all I'd want. Nothing too outrageous that would kill the goose. There's no point in saying $10.00 per mile, a new BMW and a daily foot massage.

He again asked me to wait, and said, ""Please don't cancel, I'll make sure to pay you cash for being so polite and patient with me!"" He asked very nicely, but was quite drunk. After a few more minutes, I called again. He came out and handed me 5 singles and said, ""Here is something, and I promise to take of you much more if you wait."" I have incredible patience for people... so I waited...and waited...and waited. He called me every 5 minutes to make sure I was still there. After almost 30 minutes of total waiting, he came out with two women. (This was my second longest wait ever).

After they got in the car, he started arguing with one of the women about going to another bar. She said ""No! The late night bars are all closed due to coronavirus!"" And they argued in the car for several more minutes, and she stormed out. He asked me to wait again and chased after her as she walked on the sidewalk by a park. They argued for a few more minutes, and then got into the car. He stopped by a gas station on the way, and asked me to wait again. I think he was buying lottery tickets... He came in and asked, ""How much should I give you for being so nice to me?""

I answered back, ""Whatever you feel you wish to give, I'll accept with happiness."" He opened his wallet and gave me another $35. So total of $40 for my patience. I waited all told probably about 35 minutes (at his house before pickup, at the park, and at the gas station), so I guess patience paid off in this case.

post-6451534,immadashellnottakenit...,"Aug 16, 2020 at 2:49 AM","Apparently when a**hole passengers don't want to comply with COVID mandates (wearing face-coverings - or 'properly' wearing one AND KEEPING IT ON!!!!), and/or can't or don't put in the correct address into the APP, then berate you when you call them to mitigate the error (which again, is their mistake...) and, as they all talk over one another, on speakerphone, as if you're their personal property (Oh my God, Julie, she's so stupid! - like that) Lyft allows these passengers to file health violations on you without fair process, no investigation and no tools to help protect us against such false allegations. Anyone else?? 
This (health violations against me as a driver) is received and processed by Lyft as if true, with no statement of facts, no evidence, and no proof, mind you. [If I'm an independent contractor - wouldn't Lyft's processes here be a major overreach and not at all legal? If I'm an employee wouldn't Lyft need to provide a fair and just process to investigate these claims? Once again Lyft cherry-picks processes and policies that do not reflect or support how they have unilaterally chosen to categorize drivers as independent contractors as they simultaneously choose mechanisms that control how we do our job, which includes very inequitable policies and actions brought upon us that are not supported by their claims that we are independent. If I'm independent, let me set my own rates&#8230;and so on&#8230;if I'm independent, then Lyft CANT dictates these things as if I'm their employee. Right?] 
In the case with the wrong address (today), I never even met these women. I never saw them, and they never saw me as far as their statements about how I was in the wrong place goes. I was at the exact place/pin on the map (according to the Lyft APP) yet, apparently, that was the wrong location. And, I never did figure out exactly where they were (due to the talking over one another, the speakerphone on the street, etc.). Yet, when I (an independent contractor) respond to their rudeness (and perhaps their stupidity? after several minutes trying to ascertain their location and fielding their many overlapping conversations, directions, addresses, up until the attitude began to get more directly ruder, etc.), and then finally inform them that I would be canceling the ride due to that rudeness, the account holder beats me to it and cancels; then apparently, nearly immediately, I receive a health violation alert, that threatens to 'suspend my account'! How can I get a health violation from an account holder that I never saw or met and who never saw me? Easy. Lyft's processes and policies are strictly for their benefit only - so they look good as they throw us under the bus.

Making things worse is the fact that Lyft has made responding to these allegations quite laborious, difficult, and time-consuming - for which I do not get paid for btw - and for the fact that these bogus allegations are threatening our livelihood, and our emotional and mental states (it's been VERY UPSETTING!!! VERY!!!). This is negligent and punitive in my estimation. I have had to take time off of the platform to process and respond to these claims which have had very negative effects on me and my income. I'm actually frightened to go back out there; afraid of what someones going to do next. It's so risky as it is, and now this? I feel maligned, disregarded, and without value of any kind. Of course, Lyft has contributed to this with other actions and choices prior to COVID; it's just much more dicey and scary now. COVID has definitely amplified the disfunction and negligence of and from Lyft. Since COVID I've had a passenger throw a drink at me hitting my car (for which nothing was really done and I had no available recourse), I've been threatened many times, I've had many people take their masks off in the car (one woman did her makeup while breathing on me!), I've been lied to every which way you can imagine, given all sorts of promises from passengers that they then fail to fulfill that have either put me directly at risk or took adavantage of me in some way, and generally, l get treated like a piece of sh*t more and more, and my vehicle is getting thrashed. But, Lyft has no process to mitigate those things. And they don't care either.

I've had about 3 of these kinds of health violation retaliations in the last few weeks! It's feeling VERY personal and vindictive. 1st one, Lyft said it was their bad. Great. Of course, I had to take a week off due to that because I was so upset about the false allegation. They offered no details. The 2nd one I have no idea where that stands as Lyft has not been communicating with me (and, quite frankly, they make these processes VERY difficult and laborious for which I do not get paid to unravel!!!). I have no details on that one either. Took some time off for that one too, but went back sooner because I've lost so much income already. Then I get today's. I feel like I have no choice but to do whatever anyone wants to do to me or my car (which is my personal property) no matter how degrading, upsetting, scary or unfair it is if I want the privilege to earn on this platform. I hate this!!

I'm just beside myself here. I fear for my life every time I go out there on the platform, whether it's from COVID or from the bad actions of passengers and the lack of action and fairness from and by Lyft. I'm a sitting duck.

I'm wondering how others are fairing and if anyone has any connections to attorneys in Los Angeles who could help?

P.S. And here's the doozie: Don't forget that Lyft does NOT mandate that passengers use their real and true names, or use a recent real and true photo of themselves, nor are passengers backgrounds checked - yet they're allowed on the platform, and into our personal vehicles that we use for ourselves, our families and our friends and loved ones; and these passengers can wield any accusation against us with Lyft-protected impunity. Meaning, we have no recourse should anything happen to us or our property, or if false claims are alleged - no precautions, no process, no equity. Further, when account holders bring along friends, or allow family members to use their accounts, those passengers also do not have to comply with a real and true name (today I picked up someone named ""Diagnostics"" - not her actual name), photo or background checks. If I'm doing business with someone as an independent contractor or at all, you better bet that I want and will insist on having individuals actual, true, real names and contact information! Why are we not given even that minimal amount of respect? That weakens us. That invalidates us. Lyft has sold us out and set us up for solely their gain, which is made (btw) upon the backs of each and every one of us, while they make all the rules and policies, disenfranchise us, and use us up and spits us out. And, if we are a victim of any of these passengers in any way, we have zero ways of gaining a remedy or a way to be made whole again - simply due to HOW Lyft has set this up and how they dictate this relationship must and will occur. I doubt Lyft does or would do business with folks who don't provide valid company and personal information to them, as that would legally stupid. Yet that's how they've set us up. The bottom line is: Drivers take on the majority of risk without any agency, protections, or back up. We have no benefits and no path to equitable process either. Something to think about.

She was quite young, and she said that doing part time gigs allows her to travel whenever she wanted,for at least half of the year. She is single and wishes to remain so, never plans to have kids, rents and lives very very cheaply. She does Uber and books her clients in between trips. We discussed how flights and motel stays can be had for a bargain nowadays. There is the risk of infection but she is not worried. I found her strategy of living quite refreshing. She doesn't want to wait til retirement to enjoy travel because she said she would be unable to move around as freely because of a less strong body. Does anyone take advantage of the freedom of being an ant and travel much on a shoestring budget? And if so, where would you go during this time? We went over some of her living arrangements, like sharing a rented apartment with 2 other people, and never eating out (always cooking), and it was amazing how far she went to fund her lifestyle.",2020

I let them know that I only want to work when I feel like it. Whenever I decide I want to stop working I can just go into ""last customer"" mode and stop working.

Also if I am uncomfortable with a customer or they make me feel safe I don't want to have to let them in the store.

And if they're already inside and they make me feel uncomfortable or feel unsafe I want to be able to throw them out.

I also let them know that when there's a lot of customers I feel that I should get some kind of a bonus, a ""surge"" if you will.

post-6440416,The Gift of Fish,"Aug 11, 2020 at 7:01 PM","California has been up in arms about Uberlyft's failure to classify its drivers as employees. However, California should accept at least part of the blame for the problems that it alleges, for the simple reason that it allowed Uberlyft to exist in the first place, in spite of the fact that the companies' early operations broke California law.

When Uberlyft appeared, the only way to transport pax on demand was with a taxi. It was not possible to transport pax on demand for less than taxi rates. Then Uberlyft emerged and started their operations, charging pax fares that they themselves set, with no minima imposed on them. Of course, the public loved being driven around for half the cost of a taxi. In the face of public opinion, California acquiesced and changed its laws to accommodate Uberlyft, effectively deregulating on demand for-hire transportation.

We know what happened in the taxi industry before regulation in the early part of the last century. Increasing numbers of taxis pushed fares lower and lower until it got to a point where drivers were not making enough money to survive on, or pay for basics such as being able to take time off, or being able to afford health care. Sound familiar? Fast forward to the 2010s, and we have a repeat of that scenario. Deregulation of for-hire vehicles has led to ever-increasing numbers and oversupply of Uberlyft drivers which, in turn, allowed Uberlyft to reduce driver rates to the extremely low levels they are currently at. 

Now California complains that drivers are unable to make a living working for these companies, but it shows no sign of realising that it allowed this to happen. What did California expect when it deregulated the for-hire transportation industry, disregarding the rates it sets for taxis and allowing the rideshare companies to flood the market with cars at whatever prices they like? It shows a tremendous lack of foresight.",2020
post-6438020,The Gift of Fish,"Aug 10, 2020 at 8:56 PM","Even during the longest economic expansion in recent times - throughout an ideal boom economy, Uber was unable to make even $1 in profit. But now the boom is well and truly over and global economies are crashing. Uber's rideshare business has been decimated and its losses are growing larger than ever. On top of all that, California and New York; two of Uber's largest markets, are about to force Uber to pay employee benefits for their drivers. It's not looking good.

Uber currently has $7.8bn remaining in cash and cash equivalent assets. Its current cash burn rate is $2bn per quarter. At this rate, Uber will run out of money in about a year. Conveniently, Dara says that Uber will be profitable by Q4 2021, about a year from now. However, Uber has missed all other promises of profit that it's ever made. And those promises were made - and broken - back when the economy was booming. Dara has given no information on how Uber will reach profitability within the year. It actually looks now like the end of Uber may finally be in sight.

Can Uber suddenly and magically find a path to profit in spite of all of the above before the money runs out? How? Or are they just rearranging the deck chairs at this point?

I believe that due to caution, even some of the malls up north had closed streets. I had an UberEats pickup today at a Red Lobster and as I tried to get close to the restaurant, you couldn't turn left onto Touhy from McCormick. So I entered the parking lot, and again, blocked.

Pick-up is at one of the high end resorts and was a 22 minute ride. I get there and see a person that just screams prince, I get a small chuckle from my earlier email scam thought. He was dressed very similar to below. He also had a couple leather bags that just looked expensive, similar to the ones below.

It was obvious it was the first time he used Uber as he asked me several questions on how to use it.

We get talking and he was upset there was no limo service available, and the resort he booked (avg $459 per night) was a dump. He took a limo from the airport to the resort. I ask him where he was visiting from and he tells me Nigeria. I laugh to myself, Nigerian Prince, they do exist. His destination is another high end resort that charges around $1000 per night.

Really nice guy mainly just talked about things to do while he was in town for a week and what my favorite restaurants were. He wanted to go offshore fishing so I gave him a card for one of the captains I know, the card has a unique identifier on it and every 6 offshore trips booked from my identifier earns me a free 1/2 day offshore trip. I have done 2 fishing trips now.

He dropped me a $100 tip, been a while since I got a $100 tip, think that makes my 3rd in the nearly 2.5 years I have been doing ride share. I suspect I won't get anymore rides from him as the resort I took him to has their own car service.

The mother Barbara has left a very detailed direction to her apartment. When I arrive, I could not see the keypad as mentioned. She had the nerve to tell me to enter through the guest entrance and bring 2 bags of kid's meals to her on foot under 90oF. No. This is not going to happen. After the count-down had started, I reclined my seat looking forward to claim those chicken tenders.




As I was about to turn off the hazard light, somebody honked behind me. Then I saw a woman walking toward my car. 'For Barbara?' she asked. I stared at her for a few seconds without saying a word. She then asked 'Are you postmate?' Here is my reply - Very interesting. You told me to walk to your apartment but you drive to me. Fortunately, I am not dumb enough to walk.

We would be complete clowns and block the streets to get free food......never thinking of the driver who got no tip. This ended when a co-worker had a husband that had delivered to me several times....ouch!

As an adult... if I called a place for delivery and they said 20-40-60-2000 minutes I would be fine unless it was late then no tip. The same goes for calling back and asking if they were running behind when they said 40 minutes and now it's 80 minutes and they say another 10 minutes and the driver shows up in another hour=no tip. 

Asking for something that's really important to me like hot mustard for Chinese food or blue cheese for wings. I'll stress and stress that I need extra hot mustard, if none, I can't eat that garage and don't tip. Sort of like going to a bar and asking for a Jack and coke and the Jack didn't come but they can bring it back in 40-60 minutes. 

So basically, if you delivered to me, you had zero 0% chance of determining your tip. Aside from being weird and mowing my yard, everyone else set you up for failure or my base tip of $5 and much more in crappy weather for a 5 minute delivery. 

Just food for thought if you get a bad tip, it prolly might not be your fault. 

I'll extend my thought process to inside dining. If the waitstaff says service might be a little slow or very slow because of this or that like short staff, they get a full and nice tip. If they say nothing and we complain several times over what should be a 40 minute dining experience that turns into 2.5 hours the tip will suffer. The ONLY thing that can really hurt the tip of a waitperson is being the type that knows they will earn 15-30% and they just don't care anything about service.......then they get a nice long winded note explaining exactly why they got the tip left. 

On a side note, I bartended for years, my daughter is in the food service/bartending industry and I might get into driving now.",2020

I showed the guy my phone and he said he was on hold with the customer because he could not complete the order correctly. When he got off the phone, he said he would need to cancel the order. I looked sad, so he said, ""Hey, do you want some free pizza? Because I am going to throw out all the slices because we are closing for the night."" I looked back and saw that there were a LOT of slices on the counter behind glass. Each slice from the Slice Factory is very large.

Normal week day for me 5PM comes along, I turn on the app while at my day job and do a little more work while waiting for my first ping. Pretty much tie up all my loose ends for the day so I decide to head home. As I'm walking out the door I get my first ping. 1/2 mile away on my way home.

Small apartment complex pull in and don't see anyone waiting. I'm there 1:30 and send a message I arrived. at 2:00 I send I am parked in front of the office. I see messages delivered and read. No response. At 5:01 I cancel for no show and pull into a parking spot. 2 Minutes later I get a second ping same address of course the timer starts right away as I'm already there. 1:15 my phone rings. Lady says I cancelled on her and the people I am picking up are still there waiting for me. I tell her I am in the same place I said I was in the message I sent her and that I waited 5 minutes with no response so I cancelled. She says she has no idea where the office is and the kids are at Apt 25. I ask her how old are the kids and she hangs up on me. It is almost 5 minutes now and I see the kids standing near the road. I pull up to them and see they are clearly under 18 and they have no masks. 5:00 is up I cancel for a second cancel fee. As I'm pulling out I get a third ping from her. Of course I accept and pull back in to the apartment complex. Mom calls I don't answer. Mom sends a text, please call me. I wait until the timer hits 2 minutes and before I can call she is calling me. I answer and she goes off on me in a polite way (no cursing) when she stops I tell her I cancelled the second time because Uber does not permit me taking unattended minors and they also did not have any masks on. So mom is fine I'll cancel this time and hands up on me. Bingo I hit the Trifecta, 3 cancel fees from one Pax.

I continue on my way home and get another ping about 5 minutes later. Rider cancels right away. 1 minute later ping, same person, they cancel right away again. Another minute goes by and I get a third ping from them, immediately get a message ""Stop taking my calls *****!"" and they cancel a third time. Another Trifecta with no pay, no loss to me I was still heading home. I get home and select the last ride of the 3 cancels and report it to Uber, I tell them the rider was abusive and obviously discriminating against me. I go back and forth with text message to Uber support, they finally give me a $15 bonus for my troubles, unpaired me with the rider, and will further investigate the riders actions. I suspect they won't do any other follow up but hey at least I got paid.

Alerted by the car ahead, I slowed down accordingly leaving ample distance to react. Otherwise, I would not even have noticed that idiot.




Not sure whose fault it is if he got hit. Why not be made mandatory that all cyclists should also carry liability insurance? It is absolutely the right for any individual to commit suicide. However, can that be done in a more considerate manner without getting an innocent party involved? At the very least, that idiot could have made use of the space for left turn in the median as a shelter until safe to proceed.

post-6420126,FLKeys,"Aug 3, 2020 at 12:06 PM","Sunday get a ping at 5:42 AM, 1/2 mile from my house, 6 minute trip NE, recognize the name, I have picked her up before several times. Nice young lady, 19 living on her own, works 3 jobs. No problem, slip on my shoes and head out the door. Get there and see her walking out of the gated community toward me. I say good morning XXXXXX where we going today? She tells me and I am thinking strange that is about 14 minutes SW not 6 minutes NE. I start the trip and of course the address does not match where she said she was going. I tell her she needs to change the address in the app.

She says what app? I tell her the Uber app. She says I did not call Uber I called a Taxi like I always do, your the Taxi, you picked me up several times already. I tell her I know I have picked you up several times, all through the Uber app. She responds I always call a Taxi I have never used Uber. I told her hold on and try calling the PAX trough the App. No answer after several rings. Try calling again, immediately to voice mail.

I tell her I am not a Taxi and have never worked for a Taxi, she has a very confused look on her face. She tells me she paid $48 on Apple Pay for the ride already. I tell her the ride should cost her around $30 not $48. I then tell her that this ""Taxi Company"" she is calling must be acting as a middle man and requesting rides for her via Uber. I told her if she can't change the address I'll have to end the trip. She calls the Taxi company and now they won't answer her either. She would not tell me the name of the Taxi company. 

She gets out and I end the trip instead of cancel it so I have a record of it to report back to Uber. I get my minimum fare ride and head back home. Before I get home 2 minutes away Uber adjusts the trip to $0.00. I click on the trip and and then trip issues and adjustments. Report my issue and instantly get an adjustment to $1.55 more than the minimum fare amount. Click on details and see Uber just paid me PAX paid nothing.

Do I push this more with Uber and try to tell them they are being used as a third party? Or just forget about it?

Can I order a ride for someone else and put their name in as the pick-up name? How is this ""Taxi Company"" doing it?

Perhaps I am doing it wrong, that is talking about much more time and miles but for less $ compared with transporting human cargoes. Thankfully, I have identified several chains and more expensive restaurants that always have food ready for pick-up. A majority of customers live in apartments but it is nice that most of them have provided gate codes and directions. People also seem to be more willing to tip for deliveries.

post-6399466,Young Kim,"Jul 25, 2020 at 1:21 AM","I had a suburban couple during the afternoon in Glenview, IL who I dropped off to their friends' home in Mount Prospect, IL, and they voiced a very strong feeling that the public is ""being had"". They are in the minority of my passengers, but I was intrigued by their intense feelings. They are self employed and own a sports memorabilia company where they make stuff with professional teams' logos. Like shirts, mugs, picture frames with sports' logo designs, etc. stuff like that. They asked me if I personally knew anyone with Covid or had Covid. Before I could even answer, they said, ""Of course you haven't!"" (Actually I had... some of my other passengers). They were (for lack of a better word) outraged. I am sure you have heard such stories before. That this virus is just another ""annual flu"", and stuff like that. And that doing what we are doing is going to cause much greater casualties down the line (from illness, suicide, etc.).

(Edit...I was just dropping off another passenger so I did not have time to write more), but they discussed how this virus is a ""hoax"" in that it is being used to allow the massive transfer of wealth, the greatest in history. They mentioned that the trillions mostly went to big corporations and rich individuals under the PPP and to prop up the stock market. And it was discussed that the stock market benefits disproportionately the very wealthy. They conceded after I then shared with them many passengers I personally had who either had the virus or knew someone directly who had the virus, that there could be a real Covid-19 virus, but that the disease is being blown way out of proportion to take wealth away from the masses and give mostly to the rich... and take from the following unborn generations of Americans. (end edit). 

What do you say to people who are expressing this view? I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I never dismiss anyone's opinion outright. Could there be something that we are not being told which is hidden (an extreme view). Or... is what we are doing as a world causing a ""ripple effect"" that may greater loss of life that we have yet to manifest? As I wrote before, I will follow (but not blindly) the conventional narrative simply because I don't feel I have any authority or knowledge that could refute said narrative.

Both times the riders were females.

The first time it happened the woman told me to stay in the car, I did not, she voiced some displeasure and I acted like I didn't hear her.

Today I pull up and the woman barks at me ""what's your name?"" I told her my name. Since her daughter had a large bag of sports equipment I hit the button to open the back and started getting out. Mom barks at me to stay in the car.

I hesitated and then got out. She again crabbily told me to get back in the car. At that point I told her I didn't want the ride. I explained that I want to see what's being loaded in my car and I want to be sure it's loaded right. At this point she mouth off and says that she was just trying to do me a favor but I can tell you her attitude was total *****.

At no point did she smile or have any kindness in her tone.

You guys know how it is, nobody's going to treat your car as you would. You'll let them load their own luggage into your car and they carelessly throw it in hitting the body and bumper on the way in and then just throwing it into your vehicle.

It really disgusts me the people who treat our vehicles like there's some kind of public transportation bus or train and not like it's our personal possession which we care about.

Only one case was dropped today for a cop not showing up .. the other 8 of us lost our arguments . I though most of the defendants raised decent amounts of reasonable doubt , but this old judge was finding everyone guilty. He was nice but it all seemed like sham. 

I was the last to go up and I may have gone a bit too over the top when I went after the cop. 
He was leaving out important details as I was cross examining him , and at times he was dishonest. 

I basically paid $238 for the privilege of grilling Officer Oinkin for 10 minutes. It was glorious !!! I was like an overdramatic TV lawyer . I can tell the judge thought I overstepped because I was the only one he didn’t offer traffic school too. Lol

He would ask each cop if the defendants were “polite” to the officers when they were pulled over. If the cop said yes, then he would offer traffic school. He asked every officer that except Officer Oinkin

Even though I poked many holes in the officer’s testimony, the judge still found me guilty, hit me with the full fine and did not offer me traffic school. I wasn’t going to pay for that anyway but I thought it was funny he withheld the HONOR of traffic school.

I get a typical order for Honeygrow. Nothing special. Head over to the customer. Get a text from the customer on my way. They asked if I could just park in front of house when I arrived and text them and they would come out. This is being delivered in a nicer middle class neighborhood.

As I arrive, a late teen girl walks out the front door and closes it before I text. Appears to be 17 to 19 years old. I say hello and ask her if she was the one who ordered. She responds with, ""Do you like Banquet frozen dinners? Or do you like On-cor?"". I pause as this was not what I was expecting out of the customer's mouth. I then replied, ""Well I haven't eaten frozen dinners in years so I do not really know. Are you giving some away?"". So pauses and looks up and around and then says, ""Wow, its super hot today. I think I need to take off my shoes"". She then takes off her sandals (they were the gladiator type) and then says ""Hey, do you mind holding onto these for a minute? I will be right back"" so I am like, ""Uhhhh ok?"" and she then leans in my car and puts them on my passenger seat then starts walking behind my car and across the street.

There a few younger boys playing outside, like middle school age. The girl just walks over and picks up one of their bikes and they are like, ""Hey, what are you doing!!!"" and she rides away and they try and chase after her but give up. So I am like, wtf. So I get out of the car and knock on the door. The same door the girl just exited from a few minutes ago. A woman in her 40's I think, answers the door. I ask her about the delivery. She said no one ordered food and that there was no one by that name living there. I asked her if she had a daughter or younger family member that lived there with them or was staying there and she said no. I explained to her that a girl just exited her house that looked like the person I just described and the woman got very worried and said that she had no one in the house today besides her, that she knows of. Well ok?

I start to walk back to my car and those boys are outside yelling and freaking out and one of the kid's dads are there. So as I am getting in my car, I ask them if they knew who the girl was. The one boy said, ""No! And she just stole my bike!"".

So I drive away and before I contact support I get a text and its the girl. She asked if I left and I said yes. She says meet me at the park a few blocks down. I head over and she asks for her shoes back and the food. I give them to her and she gives me a $40 cash tip. She then gets back on the bike with her shoes on and the food and just disappears.

I completed the delivery on the app then moved on. No idea what the hell that was even about. This was not some trashy looking girl or a girl who looked like she was on drugs or used drugs. I can't even begin to assume what was up there.",2020
