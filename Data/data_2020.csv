post-6658254,touberornottouber,"Dec 1, 2020 at 12:34 PM","I get a request for a 7 minute trip on Uber to pick up at Chipotle. I get there and the place is deserted (I don't think it was actually open yet) save for a man sitting at one of the outside tables. The guy looked a bit poor -- like your normal lower class service worker here really.

The guy gets in and immediately slams my door but apologizes right away. Fair play I think to myself. At least he apologized. He ended up being a pretty good passenger and he asked me a lot about Uber. I think this might have been his first Uber ride.

At the destination I end the trip and explain that it should pop up on his phone in a minute or so with a record of the trip and what it cost. About 30 seconds later he tells me that he tipped me $10 and would have tipped more but that was the most they would allow. :/

It occurs to me that this gig would be very different if every passenger tipped like him. Also don't judge a book by the cover. Sometimes what looks like a bad trip can actually end up being really good. I get the feeling the guy tried to tip me $20.",2020
post-6438395,Young Kim,"Aug 10, 2020 at 11:20 PM","Had a young lady pax so uber vegan, that I was struck by her passion. As we drove, she outlined how she first became vegan after watching the movie ""Earthlings 2005"". It is a movie about how animals are treated before they become meat for the population. It is narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. After the ride, I did watch just the preview on YouTube, and I actually shed tears (I never before shed a tear watching just a movie preview). I often like to ask a passenger who I made a solid connection with, ""What are you most passionate about in life?"" She answered with emotion...this particular pax was on a mission to turn everyone she knew to understand how animals suffer before they make it to our dinner plates. I was awestruck by her emotion and persuasion. I've met many vegetarians before, but often they were for religious reasons. This is one of the first who went all out vegan after seeing a movie and then doing her own studies. She told me that she feels that while it may take a long time,future unborn people on Earth will one day look upon present day humans with harsh feelings about how our society consumes meat on a mass scale (knowing how they were treated).",2020
post-6679137,Young Kim,"Dec 13, 2020 at 8:31 AM","Had a pax who was just working now at a restaurant who decided that for himself it made no sense to go to college until he could get the ""full college experience"". He was such a friendly guy and we discussed how going to school now would not allow him any decent experiences. He said that friends ahead of him in college have all remote learning and cannot attend classes or socialize (like going to sports games, clubs, bars, study halls). So he said that he will postpone entering school until he can really have all the experiences he wanted. 

I thought that was problably the best choice. I told him that it was likely the right decision, as college happens only once in your life, and going now may not be the best decision, especially because the cost of college is so great. He told me that a freshman at U. of Dayton pays $40,000/year in tuition alone. We agreed that for that massive of a sum, it is worth it to wait.",2020

post-6539343,FLKeys,"Sep 28, 2020 at 11:05 AM","Saturday morning around 2:10 AM I get a Comfort ride ping, I recognize the name, I took them there earlier. As I pull up there is a Sheriff car blocking one of the entrances, his lights were off. I see a deputy shinning his flash light around in the trees and dumpster area. The PAX walk past the sheriff's car and get in my car. Place is usually still pretty packed at this time, the parking lot is pretty much empty.

We pull out and as I am going down the side road toward the main road I pass a couple more deputy cars heading toward the restaurant. Lights were off. I get out on to the main road heading toward their resort and not even a mile down the road I get lit up by a deputy. I pull over and the PAX are like what the hell. I'm like I have no idea, I'm not speeding and I made sure I came to a complete stop at both stop signs I went through.

I pull over and start getting my license, registration, and proof of insurance ready, turn on the interior lights, roll down all the windows and place my hands on top of the steering wheel. I look in my driver rearview mirror and don't see anything, I look in the windshield rearview mirror and catch a glimpse of movement on the passenger side. I look in the passenger side rearview mirror and see a female deputy reach over and touch the back of my car with her left hand, then I see she has her gun drawn in her right hand.

She gets to the rear passenger window and looks in and says you are not the car we are looking for you can go. Before I know what is going on she is back in her car and driving off.

Turns out the PAX tell me some guy came in yelling and screaming and threatened to kick every ones ass and shoot up the place. Caused the place to empty out pretty quick as last call was at 2:00 and they close at 2:30. Explains why the parking lot was so empty.",2020
post-6656158,Young Kim,"Nov 30, 2020 at 6:34 AM","Saturday night around 3:30 am in Elmhurst, IL (southwest of O'Hare Airport), I drove up to the pickup location and saw 5 people standing there. I figured that there would be 2 parties and 2 or 3 pax would get into my Uber. But all five approached, only 1 was masked, and a guy tried to open my passenger side door...

(Potential pax): ""Could you please open the door?""
(Me): ""Ummm... how many are in your party?""
(Potential girl pax): ""5 of us""
(Me): ""Ummm... there can't be anyone in the front seat.""
(Potential girl pax): ""Well, all of us can squeeze in the back seat""
(Me): ""Umm... I don't think all of you can squeeze in the back of a Prius..""
(Potential girl pax): ""We can!""
(Me): ""Also, where are your masks?""
(Potential girl pax who likely ordered the Uber): ""Sorry...but I will tip you really big on the app""
(Me): ""Umm... I'm so sorry... but..
(Potential girl pax): ""Please... we waited so long for an Uber...""
(Me): ""Can you please order an XL?""
(Potential girl pax): ""We can't find one""
(Me): ""How about two UberXs?""
(Potential girl pax): ""Please can you fit all of us?""
... I'm really thinking here then why didn't they order 2 Ubers, but I realized this crowd was a few cards short of a full deck at this point... and this was the kind of bizarre behavior I would have expected over a year ago, but now? Where were these people living? I am now thinking that there was more than just alcohol involved in their past social gathering.
(Me):  ""I'm so sorry. But it would be totally unsafe""... Then I cancelled and drove off.

My very next request was a ping to the Elmhurst Police Station. I figured immediately it was a DUI situation, as it was 4:00 am in the morning. When I got to the pickup location the pax was nowhere to be found. Then I received a text message:

(Potential pax): ""Could you pick us up? We are walking down 1st Ave (I think it was 1st Ave)""
(Me) ""I don't know where exactly you are, could you give me a cross street or address?""
(Potential pax): ""We don't know where we are, my buddy got a DUI and we are walking home""
(Me) ""Then why did you order an Uber?"" (I was only 5 minutes from the pickup location so it wasn't as if they were waiting long for the pickup)
(Potential pax): ""I dunno, but we are walking down some street and there is a stoplight in front of me""
(Me) ""Sorry sir, that does not help me...""
(Potential pax): ""Well, we are almost home now, could you cancel the ride? We are so sorry to bother you""
(Me): ""Well, you should cancel the ride""
(Potential pax): ""OK, good night""
(Me): ""OK, bye!""

I waited til the timer ran down, but he cancelled right at the end. Easiest 8 bucks I made that night (2 times $4 cancellation fee)

I am wondering if anyone else recently had pax that seemed like they lost their senses and ability for rational thought...",2020

Another van shows up the same side and they walk up to driver #3.

They walk up to him and the driver points forward but I don’t hear what’s said. He walks up and asks van driver #1 what’s going on.

“they says you won’t take them because they aren’t going far enough”

“no nine of them” van driver #1 tells him. I’m standing next or van driver one and that damn other driver goes and loads 9 of them and drives off.

post-6681519,Cvillegordo,"Dec 14, 2020 at 8:37 PM","This afternoon I accepted a trip to ""Ivy Dental"" without looking closely. There is a dentist by that name here in Ivy, just west of Charlottesville. Picked up a nice Chinese girl at one of the grad student housing buildings at UVA. Very friendly right off the bat, a bit strange that she had a fairly large suitcase maybe. She was quite excited about me accepting her ride when she got in, but my brain was still not processing the information. I started the trip and it was odd that the app continued to process the trip for a couple minutes without showing the route, etc. but I thought it was just a bad signal. I moved away from the building and Boom! 

Distance to destination; 373 miles. Total time: over 7 hours. I dropped down the routing and saw; Ivy Dental. Elmsford, NEW YORK!

I turned to the pax and she clearly saw the look on my face, she said; ""We can stop whenever necessary. ""

Turns out she was going to Elmsford, NY, her home, needed to get there by tomorrow morning.

I was talking to Tron on another thread. I have been getting $1 extra on every ride in my Chevy Bolt for the past 2 weeks and wasn't sure if it was just regular quest of if it was because of Ubers EV Green program... looks like I am getting the $1 extra per ride because of the EV green program. And the payouts continue until Sept of 2021 ! Thats a big deal ..I though I could pull in $6000 extra (based on my 20 rides aday) but looks like they limit it to $4,000 still a big deal though.







The Bolt is one of very few (at a price that makes sense to buy) that actually give you enough range 238 miles on a charge (the new 2020's 259miles)

If you live in a warm climate the LT model is fine.. In cold climates, you really want the premier with heated seats (including rear) , heated Steering wheel, and USB plugs in the rear.

post-6708357,Young Kim,"Dec 26, 2020 at 2:23 AM","I wanted to post the story because I thought it was so interesting. Last night one of my passengers was coming from his apartment to the target by lincolnwood, illinois for his overnight shift. I started the conversation by mentioning how target treats their employees very well because I heard they're giving good hazard pay.

He replied that they are and that they're hiring now at his store in case I wanted to apply. We then talked about how during the holidays everybody's around family and I asked him if he was excited to be around his family. He told me he was from st Louis and he will only be spending it with his roommates.

So then I asked him if he will see his family on zoom. He replied that he would only see his sister and his niece on zoom. So then of course I naturally asked about his parents. There was a long pause... He reply that he hasn't seen his parents since he was 15 years old and he's 40 years old now.

I gauged how he looked in the rear view mirror...and then I just asked gently ""could I ask why you haven't seen him in so long? are they still alive?""

He then asked in a funny way ""is this taxi cab confession"" or a ""1 hour psychology therapy session?"" I replied that it was not and he felt uncomfortable sharing he doesn't have to...

After a long pause he said ""well I guess i'll tell you because I won't ever see you again for the rest of my life. And this is something that I wanted to tell my co-workers but I can't.""

What he told me is that he is irish and usually irish people are so close family-wise. But both of his parents were serious drug addicts who abused him mentally and physically. Shortly after he ran away from home at age 15, his sister ran away from home too. He said he has no plans to ever see his parents again and cannot forgive them for what they did to him. 

After he ran away from home he worked odd jobs and stayed at friends homes. he's very proud of what he has accomplished even though he's never gone to college. I wanted to share the story because it's very surprising that people will share their most intimate life secrets with their Uber drivers.",2020
post-6723177,MyJessicaLS430,"Dec 31, 2020 at 3:57 PM","Knowing this question is probably market-dependent, will the pandemic be an additional factor for consideration? Learning from this forum that the best time to drive on New Year's Eve is between 11pm to 4am with the incredible surge in the past years, will that even be available this year?

Personally, I have quit Ubering since the removal of Select. With the paltry $3 here and there (if there are any), it does not worth my time anymore. On the New Year's Eve in 2018, I did a few rides with the last one taken before 10pm. That was a few weeks after Uber replaced the multiplier with flat surge. With the Select fare bringing an older couple to an upscale restaurant and their generous tip, I took home with ~$70 after 4 hours of work. I cannot imagine to only driving stingy people around with base X fares alone before the real money pours in past midnight ($14+ surge in Houston core).

Anyway, to those of you who will be driving tonight, stay safe and I wish you all make bank! A lot here has experience dealing with the drunks and obnoxious but you can only imagine the aggravations associated with the 'festival vibe'. I also know some here have no problems at all driving people unmasked which I respect an individual's decision. However, for those of you who do care, allow me to share this.

post-6723841,#1husler,"Dec 31, 2020 at 7:51 PM","Well, today it finally happened. I saw and encountered a special kinda 2020 ride which I've never seen, or heard of, before...and this after I thought we've been through it all this year...in 2020 I had to take a pax through a drive through food bank (I had a buddy who drove one through a drive through COVID test!) and even knew someone who picked up a felon being released from state penitentiary (true story), but today truly surprised me.

I pulled up to an apartment, where a couple of college age guys were clearly moving house, with all their household junk on the lawn...one mini-van was almost fully loaded, but a ton of stuff remained...then this guy runs up to my car and asks me to open the hatch....after some inquiry, he divulged that he wanted to load up my car (including the passenger seat), then I should follow him in the mini van to his new place.

post-6609740,Young Kim,"Nov 4, 2020 at 2:37 AM","I picked up a guy named ar"""""""""" by franklin park illinois. I took him for a 45 minute drive all the way to the south side of Chicago he said by englewood. (The screenshot I took was about 15 minutes into the ride right before I enter the eisenhower) But on my map it says something slightly different. His story was was that he was the father of five. He is only 24 years old though. He has the children with multiple baby mamas.

I asked him what he did to support them and he said he does not have a job but just sells drugs. He had been in jail before the last time was for armed robbery he did 6 months. He said that he has post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

when I asked him why, he said that because he saw his younger brother and his best friend get shot right in front of him. His best friend was shot once in the head and two times the neck. His brother was shot in the back and in the head. he has also been shot multiple times the last time they missed and shot him through his ankle. He was wearing a cast where he had ostensibly been shot. On his right arm.

He said that both were killed not because they had done anything really serious like kill someone directly. Or steal drugs or money or rat out someone. Rather, they were just pawns in another multiple scoring side game series. He said they are almost like teams on the NBA in Chicago. There's so many active ""games"" going on. but of course the object is not just for baskets but rather for people.


He said that and he used the words is kind of like a game of ""ping pong"" out here in the south and the west side of chicago. He said it's kind of like a game of chess as well. When one person takes a piece on one side the other person tries to take a piece on the opposing side. And there are sacrifices on both sides.

I thought that most of the killings would be drug related but he said that's not the case. He said that many killings are part of a larger game going on and a larger war where multiple battles go on in different areas. Where the object is just to knock out as many people on the opposing side. and you sacrifice some of your own members to get to the higher level members.

He said that often the killing is almost on a whim. He said that if you have a friend and somebody ""scored "" on one of his other friends and was "" blocked"", then you have an obligation to help him carry out a hit. He said that if you've just met someone then of course you wouldn't carry on a hit but if you became good friends and there was a score to settle then you would sort of have to join in.

He said that it is literally an active war zone and there's so many different battles going on at once. I asked him how many games there were and he said they're just too numerous to count.

He didn't say that there's any specific areas that are more dangerous than another. He said that you have to keep on monitoring who is on any particular corner at any given time. if you go to a corner where there's someone trying to score on your team. , Which means someone's trying to kill someone on your team, then you have to avoid that area. One ""score"" means that you killed somebody on the opposing team and a ""block"" means that instead of getting killed you were able to get at least one shot off onto the other person.

He said that after three successful blocks the person trying to score on you must by street principal avoid trying to kill you for at least one week. They can try again after week but then there has to be some kind of majority vote. On who can volley for the next attempted score.

He does not talk to his father as his father has been in jail for most of his life. But he does have 5-year goals which I asked about. He wants to move out of his grandmother's house and he wants to get a job as a busboy at olive garden.

well I told him that I drive sometimes on the south of the west side and I've never had any problem, he was not surprised. he said that if you mind your own business and don't wear any fancy jewelry or drive a fancy car, then in Chicago street principle everyone is supposed to leave you alone. If someone were to inflict serious harm to someone like me who is an outsider then said that other members would actively hunt that person down because I am not actively participating in any active"" street game."" He said that now that he knows me, he said I would be protected on certain areas participates in. He was Telling other members that he was talking to on his team about me and my car and then I was ""protected* from now on. He said that he is part of a rather large group connected to other groups and they would get the word out.

I asked him how hard it is to get a gun and he said that it's so easy that if I wanted one tonight and had a little bit of money I could just pick one up from him.

Of course, I don't feel any safer. After I dropped him off I logged off and I'm back in downtown right now. Common sense is of course i'd rather be in downtown but I do not actively avoid the south of the west side either.

I found this interesting because it was quite complicated and the killings and the settlings of different activities take place sometimes over many years.

post-6633848,_Tron_,"Nov 16, 2020 at 1:03 PM","I drive in a medium sized metropolitan area in California. Not a big city. Crime is relatively low. Smallish homeless population. The few protests that occurred this year were peaceful. None-the-less, for several years now across the board I've noticed that people are becoming edgier.... more stressed out... more angst ridden. People already on the edge have been falling off it.

But in the past few months, even in the typically docile communities I traverse in my rideshare car I am witnessing events I've only ever seen on TV. Take for example a recent morning run to McDonald's for morning coffee, which ended up in a showdown not dissimilar to the Seinfeld episode where George and another driver both claim the same parking space on a New York street. The drive-through has two ordering lanes which converge to a single lane. While placing my order in lane 2 an SUV abruptly pulls in to lane 1 and starts ordering. We both pull forward to the single lane to make payment around the same time, but I end up slightly ahead of the other driver. Still, he edges his vehicle close to the car in front of us waiting to pay. I am feeling a bit anxious myself and refuse to give any ground. The Lane 1 driver has his right window down. Conversation ensues...

Me: ""I was ahead of you sir.""
Lane 1 guy: ""No. I was already ahead of you and in line.""
Me: ""No, you weren't.
Lane 1 guy: Repeats his claim, and pulls his car forward another foot.
Me: ""OK. You win. Go ahead and go."" I back up a few feet
Lane 1 guy: He mouths off some more even though he had won. I don't recall the exact words.
Me: ""Go ahead. Clearly it's important to you to go first""
Lane 1 guy: ""Well clearly it's important to you too!""
Me: ""But it's clearly  important to you""

With that last sentence I have achieved a verbal technical knockout. The driver knows this and is so frustrated by it that he exits his vehicle and starts heading to my car, announcing in a threatening voice, ""Oh, you got something to say?"". I am of course trapped in the drive-through line with no escape. I am of retirement age and this guy is half my age, twice as big, and grossly overweight.

I roll the window part way up. Then with my left hand I retrieve the can of pepper spray from the door pocket and grab my phone with the other hand. I shout out, ""Get back in your car fatso or I'll mace you and call 911.""

The guy collects his senses and retreats to his car. Now the pay window is clear for us to pull forward. I announce to the other driver, ""I'm  going to let you go ahead"". He pulled ahead, infuriated. Later when I pulled in to traffic and got caught at the first red light there was the guy again, nearly next to me. He didn't see me though, and as the light turned green he was on his horn for the guy in front of him, who wasn't moving fast enough to suit him.

---
In another incident I was driving on a two lane road that necked down to one lane after an intersection. Traffic was heavy but moving with the green light. As I crossed the intersection suddenly a big diesel pickup (4-door, duallies) lunges forward from the cross street, which had the red light. The truck turns right and is now parallel to me in what is the merge lane just before the road becomes 1 lane. The driver is flooring it and you can hear the loud diesel laboring under the load.

I choose to give no ground (I am admittedly stubborn at times), thinking that as the roadway gets narrower and narrower the driver will eventually back off. But noooooooo. He keeps moving to the left until finally I have no choice but to either let him hit me or give up the lane. I was forced out of the lane and into one of those center type lanes that allow vehicles driving in either direction to make a left turn. I then eased in behind the giant truck.

After about a mile the pickup turns off on a side street. I was still pissed off enough that I decided to follow it and get a shot of the license plate to report the driver to the police for reckless driving. Big mistake. In short order the driver pulls over to a curb. I do likewise about four car lengths back. I'm thinking the guy is going into a nearby business. But noooo. Out pops the driver and heading straight for me. The dude is MASSIVE. The word ""monster"" actually popped into my mind. He was nearly as big as his truck. Giant bald head. You know the type. Except in this case his head sort of narrowed at the top and came to a crown. Like he was deformed or something. Kind of like the extra-wide version of Zippy the pinhead.

Walking toward my car, in a bellowing voice he shouts out, ""Do you have something to say, ********?"" I was so scared I sort of froze. Wasn't even thinking about the pepper spray, which easily could have easily backfired anyway. Like shooting a 22 at a Grizzly bear and simply pissing it off. The only thing I could think of was to act like I was photographing him and the truck. Maybe fear of the incident being documented would make him back off. It didn't. Worse yet, I couldn't find the camera icon on the stupid phone, so I was just pretending to photograph him and his truck. The dude came right up to my (fully closed) window. I ignored him, steadfastly pretending to photograph the scene. In frustration he slammed his fist against the driver's window and walked back to his truck. My whole car shook from the single fist pound. Why the glass didn't break I do not know.

There have been other unusual, over-the-top vehicle incidents lately as well. But all the other ones I've just backed away from. In greater numbers, people are losing their senses at times. And you simply can't argue with a crazy person.

Finally, there was this vehicle parked in a CVS parking lot....

post-6710321,Young Kim,"Dec 27, 2020 at 9:03 AM","So toward the end of the night around 4:00 a.m. saturday night I was in evanston and picked up a lady with a suitcase. I knew that of course she's going to O'Hare airport. She was very talkative and told me that she wants to tell me a story of true love.

She said that she's reconnecting with someone that she's loved for 45 years. She said that back when she was just a teenager she went on a date with this guy named larry in high school. Both of them were so shy back then that they didn't know how to spark anything up. 

Anyway, years past and he got married and she married some lawyer. They had three children. She said the first 10 years of the marriage were good but after that it fell apart as he got verbally abusive. Then later she found out that he was hiring prostitutes for many many years. She found this out because he accidentally called her phone and left a voicemail talking to one of the call girls that he was regularly seeing. She said she wanted to stick to her wedding vows and also for children so she still stayed in the marriage.

Then 3 years ago her husband was diagnosed with ALS. It progress rapidly. She stayed back from her job to take care of him during his final years. But in february of 2019 she was in jewel and she sent a random text to larry who was still an old friend of hers over the years. 

Larry replied to her that he's in the midst of getting a divorce. She informed larry that her husband is in the terminal stages of ALS and doesn't have long to live. So in february of 2020 he said that he's coming to chicago to visit a friend. as soon as she met him in his hotel room she said there was an instant connection and it was like she met her twin flame in this life. They made love that night and the following night. She said that it was dynamite and it was the best sex she ever had. 

She's then saw him in april then in june then in july and then in september. In september of this year is when her husband finally passed away. She confessed to me even though she fell slightly guilty about it that she was finally relieved that her husband had passed. It was hard taking care of someone with that disease but she wanted to stay true to the promise of taking care of him till the end.

however her children were very angry at her for having an affair while their father was still alive. But in her mind she felt that why should she feel not feel bad because the marriage had been ostensibly over 20 years ago when they were no longer in love. And the fact that she knew that he was having affairs himself with multiple prostitutes over decades., Made it easier to have the affairs because she knew that her husband was going to die anyway very soon.

I did not judge her but during the long ride to O'Hare from evanston illinois I showed her a couple of my magic tricks on my phone. She was so amazed and she said that she wanted my phone number so that she could invite me for her friends or for children's parties of parents that she knows. I said fine and I texted her my number. 

Then later before we left she said that if she was not meeting larry that she would have loved to gone on a date with me! As we left the ride she asked me that when she comes back in a week if we could have coffee.

She was 59 years old and she had a very nice figure skinny ...but I told her that there's no way I would do anything that might compromise her new relationship with larry. I don't think that it was a romantic gesture but rather because she felt that we had such a strong connection. Anyway we ended the ride very pleasantly and I wished her well and she said that she would keep in touch with me about what happens. After a few minutes I started getting texts with her though however.

I just replied that I hope this thing with larry goes well and that you both get married. I thought it was a fastening love story that after 45 years her who was named michelle and this new guy larry could be kindle their 45 year old gap where they knew that they loved each other all along. I did tell her that sometimes this kind of true love does last or take a very long time in this case for her 45 years. but I wish her well and I hope that this new relationship completely works out. And I told her that her children should be understanding and forgive her and be happy for her.",2020

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays y'all.

I'm interested to know where you guys fall on the Holiday Mood Meter this year? I'm finding myself in the mildly irritated range and that's making me even more irritated because I'm not sure why I'm irritated to being with.

I'm hoping it's just 2020 overload and it'll pass quickly.

So...what do y'all have planned for this year's holiday celebrations? Do you have your presents wrapped already and the tree decorated or are you going the Bah Humbug route? Are you more Buddy the Elf or the Grinch this year? Are there going to be fresh cookies and milk for Santa or is he getting a Slim Jim and warm, stale beer?

Well...whatever your mood and whatever Holiday you might be celebrating I sincerely hope every single one of you can find a bit of joy this season. Lord knows we could all use it.",2020
post-6553712,OldUncleDave,"Oct 5, 2020 at 5:08 PM","Many, I mean a LOT of pax are complaining about drivers accepting trips, then cancelling. Some have been trying to get home for 3-4 HOURS, with 5-6 drivers cancelling on them, even with the (California) multiplier of 4x and 5x.

Now, some of them I can understand, but my philosophy is, if you accept the trip, you should keep it. Maybe a 5 minute window to cancel, but it is about customer service. You cancel, now I have to deal with a pissed off pax, and try to calm them down, else I get YOUR 1* .

Last night, one of my last trips of the night. 6 mile to pickup, 30 mile trip, drop off was a mile from my house. SWEET!

As soon as I accepted, text message, ""Please don't cancel on me! I've been trying to get home for 3 hours!""

post-6705059,Germanic Affairs,"Dec 24, 2020 at 3:12 PM","I don't want to be negative in the Holiday Seasons. That is not my intent. Many of you work Uber because you have nothing. Many of you work Uber because you are unempolyable. Many work Uber because they are social outcasts. Many work Uber because they are lazy. Many work Uber because they don't have the ambition to do something else or the ability to use their brains to find something. Like I said I don't want to be negative and emphasize these type of problems, I don't even want to mention them.

Thing is, if you don't do anything things only get worst. Waiting for a miracle is silly. I keep hearing people say ""Thank God 2020 is over"" or ""I am so happy 2020 is finally over"". I merely ask a simple question. Why? Why is it good 2020 is over? What makes you think 2021 will get better? Why couldn't 2021 be even worse?

The only way to better yourself starts with yourself. Don't depend on others. You need to be the one that finds their way out of the trap. I hope with the Holiday Season you are all going back to school or starting school, or starting a apprenticeship or you are starting a job in something that you can get skilled or educated in something marketable or you are getting certified or licensed in something in demand.

Anyways have a Merry Christmas, go to church, confess your sins, and start the New Year's as a new human that is productive and worthy of society. That actually does something for humanity, not just applying for unemployment and accepting pings from your car all day.

Drove passengers for the first time in weeks this afternoon. People were driving like maniacs, as has been the case since the protests - cops seem to have mainly thrown in the towel around here. 

Was driving on I-64, saw a major collision on the opposite lane. Less than half a mile away, came up on a multi vehicle collision with an obvious fatality that had happened within minutes before. 

Had a passenger, felt powerless. Wanted to stop. Saw this poor elderly man dead and who knows about the other car, crashed in the median on the other side of the road. 

If not for me missing a turn because my pax was back seat driving, I would have likely been in the middle of this. Today wasn't my day (or my pax). Saw several other minor accidents heading home, driving carefully as I could. 

Always tell your loved ones that you love them before you leave (I always kiss my pup and tell my wife I love her, even if she's pissed at me for something), SLOW DOWN, and please be careful.

post-6683603,Young Kim,"Dec 16, 2020 at 6:04 AM","I was driving near Golf Rd, and Waukegan Rd around Morton Grove, IL when I got a ping request for UberEats (around $4 payout) at a place called ""Wings and Things"" on the app. It is a low offer but I saw that the pickup was only 1 minute away and the dropoff was just 2 minutes down the street. When I accepted, I immediately got a second ping from the same location. It was for $9 so I also accepted that. When I pulled into the parking lot, I could not find the name on the store window, but saw an open restaurant with the lights on. I confirmed the address number even though it was not the actual name on the front. I called out as there was nobody behind the counter. After awhile, a guy came out. I told him the two names on the order, a ""Dani"" and a ""George"".

I am usually very friendly with my greeting but this guy sort of ignored it and seemed like he was in a very bad mood. I recognized him from earlier deliveries and recalled his unfriendly nature. He curtly said that George was ready but Dani (the 4 dollar order), would be 5-10 minutes. I then very nicely explained to him that the Dani order was a 4 dollar order, and since it is not ready and the second one was on the counter and was a 9 dollar order, that maybe I should cancel that order and allow another driver to take it when the food is ready.

I very kindly told him, ""My friend, if the $4 order can be ready in 5 minutes, then I can wait. But if you think it will take 10 minutes or more, then maybe I will cancel and let another driver take it because it may not be worth it for me to wait?""

(Then he surprised me with the following words)

He abruptly said: ""I really don't care if you take either order because I get paid either way. When I click on the ""accept"" button then I get paid. If you cancel I don't care because I get paid no matter what.""

(and then the following words REALLY pissed me off)

He continued on in a proud entitled way, ""I want you to know that I really don't care at all what  make in tips""... ""Because I get paid...so whether you make nothing or something, ""

The reason why this last sentence really upset me is that he was so demeaning to all delivery drivers. He was not just targeting me, but . He acted so proud as if we delivery drivers were so unimportant to him and what we got paid, because he would be paid regardless. And he said it in such a rude manner. You had to be there to understand it.

I was surely going to cancel...but I remembered reading here on someone else's post that in fact what he said was true, that the restaurant gets paid by Uber whether the delivery is made or not. So I politely said, ""OK, if it will be a short while, then I'll wait."" and I smiled. In retrospect, I should have just cancelled probably, but I was already there, and in the back of my mind I wanted to let him know that I was a patient person and a polite person. After about 8 minutes, he came out with the food. At this point, I calmed down a little, but I tried to explain to him (and this is where many of you may disagree with me because I confronted him) that his words, ""I want you to know that I really don't care at all what you guys make in tips""... ""Because I get paid...so whether you make nothing or something, I don't care"" was rather mean and insensitive.

I said to him, ""Respectfully sir, I wish to tell you that I was not blaming you at all that the food was not ready or that the customer did not leave a decent tip, but rather the reasons why I may have wanted to cancel the order that was not ready. I thought what you said about delivery drivers in general and how you don't care what we get paid is mean and actually rude...""

But suddenly he raised his voice and got all defensive and spoke down to me in an insulting fashion, ""Look, you are not supposed to even tell me what you are getting paid. That is not your job. You guys' job is just to come inside, not say anything, get the food, and leave!""

I realized I was almost to lose my cool... I took a deep breath, and said, ""OK, thanks. Goodnight, and I wish you well and please understa......""

I could not finish my sentence because he just walked away out of sight behind a wall.

Surely if I ever get this location again I will reject the order. But I really had a passing thought of wanting to smack him. I recall I even clenched my fist for a moment. He was behind the counter in a very drab, sort of beat up fast food restaurant with no seating. Why would he act so proud and mighty and say rude and insensitive things to me and about all delivery drivers. He targeted all UE and DD drivers by saying, ""I don' care what you guys make, I get paid anyway"". I did not act angry that the food was not ready or that the customer's tip was lousy. I only tried to explain to him the reasons why I did not want to wait for the second order (indicating that for a tiny payout it may not be worth it if I had to wait a long time).

I am certain that other drivers have had similar experiences. I wish that Uber did not pay out the restaurant immediately like this. Then if I could cancel I may feel that if the food is not delivered then he would be affected. But if he is paid the instant he clicks ""accept"" then maybe this is why he acts this way to delivery drivers?

I did ""thumb down"" the delivery and gave a reason ""unprofessional staff"". I also called UberEats support on my way to the second order and complained. The rep took down my information and said she would forward it on. I tried to find the place again just now through Google to write a negative review to describe what happened to me, but the restaurant name was not even on the search when I typed in the name I recall on the app! I do recall the second order, at the exact same location, even had a different name for the restaurant! It was two words, ""Future"" and then another word. Since the orders are done, I cannot contact an UE support rep live to find the name of the restaurant.

Would you have been as incensed and pissed off as I was? I was disappointed because he acted so high and mighty and dismissive, even though I was so polite and said and did absolutely nothing to provoke him or accuse him of anything. It would be a different matter if I was rude to him first... in retrospect I think that in his infantile world he thought that when I said I may cancel the order if the wait is too long then I am warning him that if he does not produce the food soon that he won't get paid. I think that was what he thought, so he would prove his superior position by stating that he could not care if I did so because he is already paid. But I did nothing to suggest that. At all.

The shop I get my rental cab from also has a chauffeur business on the same business model more or less. Aside from booked chauffeur fares they are also on the Uber platform.

This morning I was talking to one of the chauffeurs and told me that he got deactivated off Uber for a bullshit face mask complaint.

In the middle of the ride he asked the customer to put her face mask back on then she accused him of not wearing a mask while driving her. This lead to him losing access to Uber.

“Dude that sucks, your not in trouble with Mears over that are you?”

No, this was a month ago and they just gave me a copy (company lingo for chauffeur fares) driving one of the execs today so I’m sure I’m fine.

“Makes me feel better about my Uber rating” I tell him.

“my friend eventually everyone gets false complaints. Don’t worry about Uber eventually we’ll all get kicked off.. I’ve been at Mears for 20 years and driving VIPs for 15. But I’m still dream team so don’t worry about Uber at all”

“wait your one of the guys who gets the Saudi princes and whoever?” I ask.

He just chuckled at me and nodded.

Yeah the guy who has been doing this for 20 years and is trusted with Saudi Princes gets a false accusation just because he politely asked her to put her face mask back on.

more talking later and he said that he only picks up a car on days that they have chauffeur business for him to do. I looked over his shoulder and recognized the name of his clipboard of his customer.

His name was ""B"", and we started out talking about how the economy and the job market is terrible. He told me the business for drug dealers is good. He then went on to tell me he sells a lot of adderall, weed, coke, and Xanax ""ladders"" (as he called them). ""B"" told me that regarding Empire, that was his main source to get things to sell in Chicago (I understood the underground site lets you buy anonymously and pay anonymously with Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency). But he informed me that the marketplace disappeared, and the owners of the site ran off with 50 million dollars a day ago. He was sad that now he will have to start finding a new source for goods. (He was using someone else's Uber account, a relative he said. And I didn't know that he was not using an account associated with his own name until midway through the ride until I kept calling him the wrong name and he corrected me).

post-6687891,MyJessicaLS430,"Dec 18, 2020 at 1:51 PM","I want to share these 2 deliveries which did not have a good start but ended sweetly.

Can you people really shuffle food these days? I thought I could with this one after making 2 futile attempts in calling the customer. It was a $50 order from a pizzeria that could translate to my dinner that night and also feeding me the following day. What is the logic of the 5-minute timer if drivers cannot keep the food? Not advocating for shuffling here but don't we deserve to be compensated for the waiting time?

As what you would expect from Lyft, Postmate also loves to sneak in an ""offer"" without notifying us. At first, I thought it was not a big deal because the drop off location was added along the route. Not until I slided the ""complete pick up"" button, it was too late to realize the possibility of scam due to the red flags of ""teen"" and his message ""I don't want my parents to know"".




Days after the failure to shuffle the pizza and Lasagna bolognese, the customer tipped me decently.




To my surprise, that underage customer also tipped me 2 weeks after the delivery. I am certain that he did tip because the $10 tip from the first delivery showed up the same evening. However, I still do not have any faith in the younger generations. Keeping the photo I took at his front door and also a selfie video showing I walked back to my car empty will become extremely useful should one day his boredom provokes him to do something dirty.

post-6495782,Wildgoose,"Sep 4, 2020 at 1:16 PM","It has been almost a year now. One evening around 4:00 pm, I got a ping with a male's name. I drove to the pick up point and wait a couple minutes and I saw a teen couple coming out. When they reached to my car, the boy opened the door for this girl. She got in and sat, then they were exchanging a few words. I realized that the account owner requested Uber for the girl and it was 30 mins ride. After they said see you later, I drove off and trying make a U turn, as we were going to Oakland West Bart station. After 400 feet from pick up point, I noticed that this girl started crying silently. I was being silent and waited for a few minutes but she didn't stop her silent crying. then I asked ""Is there something wrong, Honey?"" Then she started crying out.

As we were heading to Oakland, she told me her story. She is 18 and just gave a birth with that boy. She had no job. Her mother kicked her out of her house but kept the baby. She had asked help from police but they delivered her to a hospital. That day she was discharged from hospital and tried reach to her boyfriend, father of her baby. That boy was living with her mom and still in school, had part time job. Her boyfriend also didn't accept her to give temporary shelter as well. She had been her boyfriend's house since morning and seemed he tried to kick her out before his mom came back from work. So she was going to Bart station and hoping to get connected her friends.

It was a really sad story of her. I was trying to encourage her to call her mom and beg. I tried several times to call her mom. She refused and cried, cried. She told me I don't know her mom but I know how a parent would be worrying about their run away kid. She didn't give me her mother's contact number so I have no choice but to send her to her destination. As it was getting dark and because of her weak plan, I asked her if she had done her dinner. She said No. I asked if she was hungry and she said she was starving. That bastard of her boyfriend, didn't even offer her a meal the whole day. So I decided to buy her dinner so she won't be hungry the whole night. I told her that I would buy her something to eat but we had to finished the ride first at destination. And told her to let her boyfriend know. She said her phone was not in service, and she would only have wifi to connect when she got free wifi spot. Alright then, let it be.

As I finished the ride, I asked her what she would like to eat. Chinese, Pizza, Burger, whatever, I would want to fill up your stomach full for the night so she wouldn't be hungry before she found help. This poor girl just choose McDonald's burger. I felt sad. She didn't want to use my money too much. As per her choice, I drove to McDonald's and let her order her burger at drive through. She did order just one burger. I told her it won't be enough and should order more burger. She refused my offer. Then I told clerk to add meal with the burger and make it two burger. And I drove her off at her destination Oakland Bart station Again. She would enjoy her food there.

At the drop off, as she got out, I got out off the car as well. I wanted to give her a good luck hug but I didn't. I didn't want to make physical contact to my ex-pax because of R/S policy. So I could just wish her good luck and gave her Obama's famous word for strength "" You can do it.""

I hope she is doing well right now. She will never forget about an Asian guy was trying to help her.
As I left, I cursed her boyfriend really bad. Because of him, she was pregnant and gave birth. Because of that she was kicked out from her house. That M.F didn't try to give her shelter or didn't try to help her out with some money. The worst was he didn't even offer her a meal the whole day and for night.

post-6680129,Benjamin M,"Dec 13, 2020 at 9:48 PM","A few weeks ago, I had an incident after I accepted an Uber X trip that turned out to be actually transporting a contaminated inflatable hospital bed from one nursing home to another.

I was promised a tip in exchange for this, it was pretty clear that I was shafted. I was pissed so I followed up, apparently my email correspondence ended up going to the account holder and he (unsuccessfully) attempted to get me deactivated.

That thread is here - Thread 'Transported an ""air mattress"" and ""I will tip you in the app""' 

That situation, along with horrible pings for pax and non tipping on delivery, made me decide to -

Thread 'Working on my exit' 

In between online programming courses, I came across these videos on YouTube.




So, she was doing Doordash for two whole weeks. A customer pulled a scam (what a surprise) and, instead of calling Doordash, she decided that the best idea was to return to the customer and confront her while recording on her phone.

She then doxed the customer (I did not) to the point that the pharmacy had to disable reviews on Google. And, in the first linked video, there is a link to send her money.

Key lessons -

1. If you are doing deliveries, regardless of the platform, call support immediately if you are accused of not delivering the order. A friend of mine recently had this happen, I encouraged him to call Uber and he did. But he decided to quit, after being threatened with deactivation.

2. If you are pissed off, let it go - especially if your first idea is to point your phone in the customer's face and put it on YouTube. Yes, I posted a video here ages ago of a bad pax. It was not a public video, I blurred his face, and I later deleted it. Bad idea all around.

3. Doordash sucks, they can keep their stupid Red Card and buggy app - that's just my opinion &#128514;",2020
post-6647388,O-Side Uber,"Nov 24, 2020 at 1:18 PM","I had just picked-up a delivery order from an outdoor shopping mall and was leaving the place when this incident took place. I had pulled out of the shopping center and came up on a streetlight with a crosswalk. The light was turning orange so I slowed to stop for it. 

As I was coming to a stop, this woman appeared in the crosswalk and I had to give the brakes a somewhat hard stop because I didn’t want to risk coming too close to her in the crosswalk. She had not even turned her head to look for cars when she stepped into the street . She seemingly appeared out of no where. 

I stopped in time so It should not of been an issue , but this woman was clearly enraged that I had to hard stop 3 feet before the crosswalk. 

She appeared to be in her mid 30’s, dressed in scrubs , big face diaper on carrying some shopping bags from the various upscale stores there. She turned to me and gave this crazed look. 

At this point I pointed to my eyes and then started to mime like I was walking in place . Basically I was trying to say look for cars when your walking...I did this more in a comical way because I already felt she was over reacting . 

That’s when the events turned nuts. She stormed up to my car window . Now try to imagine a horror movie where the maniac is suddenly staring at you inches from your face , eyes bugging out like a crazy person . That damn mask 😷 in my face. You guys know how I feel about the masks! 

I calmly roll my window down and turn my head to her. She is still bugging like she’s going to punch me. I calmly told her she should at least turn her head before marching into the street so she doesn’t get hit by a car that doesn’t see her. I thought I was being logical. 

Whelp, she started screaming under her mask that she’s a pedestrian and it’s a crosswalk. I agreed however I stopped 3 feet before it so GET THE F AWAY FROM ME !!!!! I yelled back. That’s when things became violent . 

She became UNHINGED and started high stepping my car door , repeatedly kicking it . This is my new car I owe $18k on btw. I threw my car in park , fumbled with the door lock , finally got the door open before about the 3rd kick to my door. She was mid-kick when I opened it , so she fell back on the street . 

I was close to losing my temper but I was well aware that she was a woman and I don’t punch, kick , slap or stomp women. However, I will protect myself and my property the best I can bring a civilian with no training on how to do so . 

I was furious at her for putting me in this situation and damaging my car. I bent down and ripped her shopping bags from her hands . My thought was I’ll throw these as far as I can into the street as payback and hopefully she’ll go chase them and I can escape. We’ll that’s not how it went. 

Firstly , small bags of clothes don’t throw very far. It was like trying to throw a feather. The bags only landed like 8 feet away . As I turned to jump into my car and split, she jumps up and tries to get in my car before I do. 

She was almost all the way in my driver side as a grabbed her by the back of her head and peeled out off my my car and just kind of threw her away from the car. 

Now she is playing the victim and started screaming for help . I’m just trying to get away at this point. I was just about to shut my driver door when like the Terminator she jumps back up dives into my driver side window , which is still rolled down from earlier . I’m now in a horror movie. Night if the Living Covidiot. That’s the only way I can describe it. 

She knocked my side view mirror backwards and is now clinging on to my door bending it down . I was wondering why my car wasn’t moving only revving in place .. the emergency brake was on . I calmly told her .. let go of my car, let go of my car , let go of my car.she screams No!! I then popped the e-break and punched it. She flew off , I bailed . What the F just happened???? Holy shit!!! I looked in my rear view and there were like 3 cars behind me. I’m assuming jail is coming for me. 

I called my girlfriend and told her what happened . I got her phone number and wrote it on my arm . No one remembers phone numbers anymore . Now the funny part is , I actually delivered the $4 order I picked up so I wouldn’t lose access to the app. 🤡 I then headed toward home when a local number called me , I answered. 

Who is it? THE POLICE DEPARTMENT!!! 👮‍♀️ 
My life is over.....or is it????

He says “Hi Oside Uber! Do you mind coming back to the scene where the women attacked you? We have her here in the police car 🚔.” I was very calm and compliant . I let him know I was 10 minutes away and headed back over there. 

I show up and there’s like 6 cop suburbans, K-9’s. About 10 cops standing around . No ambulances luckily. He checked the damage to my car and got my statement . They seemed to be holding back laughter over it all. He assured me no one was in trouble. I told him I didn’t intend to press charges. He kind of laughed and said he didn’t think I would . I consider myself lucky she didn’t get hurt . 

I’m sure the Dudley Do-Rights on here will rip me a new one for getting into an altercation with a female , but you never expect these incidents when they happen . 

Everyone is stressed out. My car door has a nice dent in the bottom of it but I was able to bend the door back up so I closes properly . Go ahead, tell me how YOU would’ve handled my situation .",2020

post-6618906,Reynob Moore,"Nov 8, 2020 at 2:41 AM","This just happened about 30 minutes ago.

I have done well over 7k rides total on lyft and uber combined. I am cool with almost all my passengers. They always thank me, we usually have a nice conversation, and exchange pleasantries. Let me explain what just happened.

I was on my way home after doing about 30 trips today and grossing about 385. I put lyft on destination mode and figured Id do one more pickup. It was a young looking female with a rating of 4.8. 4.8 I thought? Thats pretty low, I wonder why. About halfway there she texts on the app asking me ""Can I confirm pickup""? which was odd. I figured this must be the reason shes rated low, as unnecessary texting is no doubt not only annoying to me but others as well. Nonetheless, I responded saying Im on the way. To which she responded thanks the app is acting weird.

I arrive and wait about 2 minutes and she comes out. She mispronounces my name then apologizes and says ""Max will be right out"". I said ""Max, oh ok. I love how you act like I know him"". Half annoyed at the fact that she mispronounced my name and half being a smart ass.

So she starts yelling at max to come out and I say Ill give him one more minute. She keeps yelling for him and finally he comes out. Dude gets in and says ""Hey buddy"". To which I really didnt want to respond but I wasnt trying to be too much of a dick so I gave him a disinterested ""Whats goin on"".

A minute or two later she starts saying she put in 2 stops, one of them a taco bell drive thru. I told them we dont do drive thrus. She says ""Are you not ******, referring to my name. Now im starting to get pissed as she damn well knows my name and is acting as if someone is my boss or overseer. She persists about the taco bell drive thru even after I said I suppose I can make an exception and really pissed me off. So I pulled over and said ""You know what you guys can get out right here"".

The dude says ""Are you serious""? I say yes. He then says ""Youre a piece of shit"". I said ""excuse me""? He said ""You heard me"".

At this point I went from 0 to 60 in about half a second. ""Get out of the car right now"" I said. I get out and slam the driver door. About 30 seconds or so later they both emerge. I can see he is drunk. He puts his hands up and says ""Im not gonna fight you"". I can see he is legit scared so I said ""Im not gonna fight you but this is ridiculous"". The dumbass girl is still pointing to the app and saying ""Arent you ******"" blah blah referring to my name as if Ive been appointed to be her servant or something. So there they are standing on the curb on the side of a road a couple miles from where I picked them up and I get in my car and drive off.

It was really cold tonight. Let that be a lesson to these entitled drunk idiots.

That being said, how would you have handled the situation? Would you have gotten angry and kicked them out for acting the way they did? Or do you think I overreacted? When the guy called me a piece of shit for telling them to get out honestly I was ready to beat some ass. Im glad the dude backed down or that could have been really bad.",2020

I pick up this guy in Wheaton, Illinois and he’s totally wasted and he’s going to this party and he’s trying to get me to go with him and I kept telling him that I couldn’t go I had to work so he starts calling me a p***y and if you’re a guy you know how that feels so I put aside my pride and I kept telling him no. So, now he gets on the phone and he calls the girl who’s throwing this party and he puts her on speaker and he starts telling her to convince me into going and shes like don’t be a sissy and come over I’ll introduce you to a bunch of my girlfriends so ok two problems here, one she said dont be a sissy and then she says I’ll meet a lot of girls so guys you know how we are in situations like this so she finally gets me to commit and now I’m stuck.
We were now about five minutes away and I’m trying to think if there’s any possible way of getting out of this and by the time I pulled in the driveway I couldn’t come up with one reason so here I am being dragged into this party by a guy who I just met and whose acting like I’m some kind of big fish he caught in the lake and this is one of those times you wish you had a time machine.
Now, as I’m walking in with this guy it finally hits me “COVID”! I forgot about that and this place is packed with Latino gang members who not even one person at all is wearing a mask or doing any kind of social distancing so without even thinking I said oh wait, I forgot my mask in the car and then I got this who farted look from everyone in the room so I guess I’m not getting my mask so this is where the trouble comes.
Well, first off all, the girls I was supposed to meet all had boyfriends and the three who didn’t looked like tow trucks so now I realize that I’m not getting any action but here’s the worst part, my drunk passenger is introducing me to every single person in this party like Im some rock star, well that’s what I thought at first and then I realized that he was saying here’s my Uber driver Ha Ha Ha and they were all cracking up laughing at me and in the meantime I must have had thirty people spitting all over me on top of shaking hands and getting hugged so now I’m screwed!

post-6578133,Fusion_LUser,"Oct 19, 2020 at 1:45 PM","I didn't drive on Saturday night because I wined and dined my wife (Olive Garden To Go so we could watch The Walking Dead at home) so I did go out on drive on Sunday... lately it's been busy enough to turn my back on religious fulfillment and sell my soul to the Uber Devil.

Anyway I get a ping at 4.1x for a 4 mile ride that will be about 15 minutes. The pax had a 4.6* rating and it's at a local restaurant that is pricey so I figure this will be another smooth ride.

I get to the restaurant and did the usual text ""I have arrived.""

The pax responds, ""Are you my Uber driver?""

(Really?)

Me: Yes
Pax: Are you out front?
Me: Yes I have arrived.
Pax: I'm on my way out, meet me at the front please so I know its you.

It was almost 3 minutes that passed and I get that feeling I may cancel this ride when a 40ish white lady comes out and stares at me and my car and her phone for almost 30 seconds! She slowly approaches the car and I roll down the passenger window and ask ""Are you Maria?"" She nods yes and again looks at her phone then at me as I unlocked the doors...

Maria opens the rear passenger door...

Maria: Are you my Uber driver?
Me: Yes.
Maria: You are Fusion_LUser?
Me: Yes.
Maria: Do you have ID to show?

(OK I was not expecting that question at all and I was stumped on what to say, I was thinking did this lady really just ask me for ID???)

Maria: I need to see your ID!
Me: We don't show ID, Uber has my picture car and license plate for you to verify I am your driver.
Maria: But you are wearing a mask! How do I know its really you?
Me: We are not required to show our ID miss.
Maria: I need to see your ID to verify you are who you say you are.
Me: Miss I'm not giving you my ID if you like you can cancel the ride.
Maria: I should not have to cancel the ride when you are not complying with the law by identifying yourself.

(This ride is over I just need her to shut my door. I was going to cancel by saying the pax was a no-show but I just decided to cancel the ride...)

Me: Miss I'm not going to hand you my wallet or ID. If you want to see my ID you can come to my window and look at my ID with my window closed.

(Maria lifts her head out of my car and before she heads to my side I channel my father and say ""Close the door you are letting all the cold air out!"" and she closes the door.

<Doors locked> <Ride cancelled>

When she gets behind my car I slowly pull away. I contemplated letting her come up to my window so I tell her she is a complete nut job but I just decided to keep my mouth shut and move on.

I have yet to see anyone mention they had to show ID to a pax. Has anyone ever had one ask for ID? She didn't say what kind of ID so maybe she thinks rideshare drivers need ID like taxi drivers?",2020

I got 5 rides back to back that were all around 3-5 miles from airport and all surged at 5x. After I dropped my pax off I raced back to the airport and kept getting ping after ping, it was great! I'm assuming it was only because I was the only driver in queue? I was getting calls for pickups around the airport also which I declined and all were standard fare price, not surging.

post-6338836,Young Kim,"Jun 28, 2020 at 5:51 PM","I just had a memorable ride. I drove to a house for a pickup in the suburbs. Once there, I saw the garage door open, and there was a lady at the back of the garage by the door in a wheelchair. She called out that she needed help so I went to her and pushed her down the driveway to my car. I opened the door and she told me she had cerebral palsy and would need help. I gave her my hand but she said she really could not move her body well. So she said she would need to put her arms around my neck and that I would have to carry her. I was fine with this but since she was around the same body weight as mine, it took some time. The only issue I had was that as I positioned her in my back seat, she sort of fell sideways and slightly hit her head on the opposite door (not hard) before I could put her seat belt on. I put the wheelchair in as best I could... I drove her to church which was four blocks away. I wheeled her into the church and sat her down and positioned her carefully as Mass was starting. She had no complaints and was happy but I was afraid she could have been injured while I was placing her into my car. Has anyone been in a similar situation?",2020
post-6678628,Erik M,"Dec 12, 2020 at 10:00 PM","I picked up my Pax from Costa Mesa, CA last Friday night and drove her to work, “The Fritz” stripclub on Katella near Disneyland. After about 5 mins she takes her seatbelt off and says “sorry but I’m really uncomfortable. I just bleached my butthole and now I think I’m having a reaction to it”. She pulls a wet nap from her bag and reaches down the back of her skirt and I’m assuming she starts wiping or scratching with it. I kinda chuckled about it but kept driving and looking forward not wanting to make a big deal out of it. Then after a few mins she starts squirming around again, she does this the whole 15min trip. When we get to the parking lot of the stripclub she says “I know this is strange but I need you to look at my butthole and tell me if there’s a rash”. Apparently if there’s a rash on their genitalia they aren’t allowed to work so she didn’t want to ask her co workers. She bents over my backseat and pulls her underwater to the side and asks me to “please look”! I told her very politely that it was a very ackward situation for me and I didn’t want to be accused of wrong doing by helping her with her problem. She then wipes it again with a wet nap, mutters how uncomfortable it was then grabs her stuff and leaves the car. I immediately email Uber and explain the entire situation and save the dash cam video in case something comes of it. Today I get an email from Uber saying they’ve deactivated her account for violating their sexual harassment policy and asks if I need any kind of cousiling from the incident. It says it’s free of charge if I decide to accept it......Yea right like I need counseling from it! I didn’t mean to get her deactivated, I was just covering my ass. We as Men are always being accused of sexual misconduct and I didn’t want to be a statistic.

But, RS is absolutely not what it was before. Tips are unimaginable, false allegations are up, and we're at risk of yet another potential harm to our health and well-being - while rates have been reduced in many markets.

I have been off the road for about two weeks (by choice), spending my time catching up on programming (many years of experience, needed a break) and waiting for some support through PUA.

My enthusiasm for driving has made some even think that I am an employee and not a driver. As much as I wish that were true, I also mourn the loss of Richmond's GLH and the staff there, they were always on my side - now completely gone.

Hoping for success in web dev yet again and I am not putting off the idea of driving again in the future, hopefully as it was intended - a side gig.

After completing one trip, I headed to pick up my next passenger, and about 4 miles into the trip to pick her up, she calls me. So, after cheerfully answering the call, here is how the rest of the conversation went:

My passenger: Hi, I'm your passenger. When will you be here?

Me: Well, all of that information should be in your app.

My passenger: It keeps on telling me different things.

Me: Ok, I'll check for you, just a moment (I'm physically holding the phone and have to toggle to get back to Uber). Ok, looks like I'll be there in 9 minutes. What does your app say?

My passenger: I can't see it because I'm on the phone? Where are you?

Me: I'm 9 minutes away.

My passenger: But where are you?

Me: All I can tell you is that I'm 9 minutes away.

My passenger: You mean you can't tell me where you are?

Me: Hangs up phone and cancels the ride.

Now, I'm a really friendly driver once I pick up passengers, and if a customer needs to call me for legitimate reasons, I have no problem with it, but when they have everything they need to know in their app, and still call me anyway, it just irritates me.

post-6650414,Young Kim,"Nov 26, 2020 at 8:27 AM","While driving around pax these days, I discuss subjects (if they are interested) like the weather, the pandemic, Uber, stocks, physics, sports, and magic. Yesterday I discussed with a pax about autonomous cars and she said she would never get into an autonomous Uber or autonomous Tesla. She told me that she could never feel safe not being able to yell or correct a driver. We then discussed the bizarre toppy stock market. After breaking 30,000 on the DOW, we just reflected that by any measure the U.S. stock market is trading at valuations which I find troubling.

We discussed Uber's stock price which I follow and its lows a few months ago at the middle of the pandemic was 13.71. A couple of days ago it traded to 52.00. I understand the successful court victory in California... but after announcing more losses in their latest earnings report, I am amazed at our mothership's stock ascent.

As I drive around and do deliveries these days, business is not something that I would imagine could propel the Death Star's stock so high... UberX is rather slow, and UberEats is replete with $2.50 offers. Surge has almost gone non-existent. This tells me that business must not be good for Uber. But the Mothership's stock races at all time highs? I also understand that a vaccine is upcoming, so that is promising...

I dunno, but methinks that a near term top in Uber's stock is in short order... If business is in the toilet and the stock is at all time highs, with a grey zone towards profitability, I am looking for an imminent attack on the Death Star's stock price.",2020

I was waiting for my passenger Sarah and her Husband, they ended up tipping me $8 after I told them a skinny dude got into my car and I kindly told him I'm waiting for Sarah and he called me N word. He got into my car from a Cowboy Jacks bar in downtown Minneapolis. His racism came out when he got pissed that I wouldn't be able to take him. That time MPD would've booked me in had I induced Coma on him, but luckily for him I have self control. I weight about near 100 pounds more than he did
 . That image of me is before adrenaline rush and muscles enlargement in a fight, imagine how I would look fighting him. I'd be 2 times bigger looking than that image with muscles in fight or flight situation.
I was able to come close to guessing his weight by exactly how skinny and shorter than me he looked. Taller skinny guys can weigh more, but this dude didn't have any friends for backup and right in front of the bar he decided to call me N word. Can you guys believe in America there are white guys calling black people and especially black workers in Uber transport like myself the N-Word? I have never been called it and I have lived in the US since 1991 but he was first to actually call me this. He wanted a black man to drive him, but he was racist himself the whole time",2020

I may have gotten just 1 surge ride (and a minor one) over the weekend, and I worked all three nights until the wee hours of the morning. So I can fathom that business for Uber is rather bad. But the stock I see this AM is trading at all time highs, around 50 bucks a share. And Uber stock's low this year was 13.71! More than tripled... but things are really bad out there. Probably even worse than when the pandemic first shut everything down in early March. Of course, I understand the stock markets, very rarely rational... But how our mothership and the Imperial honchos at Uber corporate must be celebrating!",2020
post-6474152,PioneerXi,"Aug 25, 2020 at 2:00 AM","I drive a black Chevrolet Equinox. It has plates issued by the California DMV on the front and rear, and those plates are not issued to any other vehicle. The vehicle is fitted with an Uber and Lyft sticker on the front and rear windows.




I am a caucasian male, 6 foot tall, short brown hair, and a mustache. When you order an Uber, my photo comes up in the app. It's a good photo of me too.

I'm also married. My Wife is short, 5 foot tall (in heels), shoulder length natural red/burgundy hair, and has a spectacular chest.

She does not have a mustache.

When the Covid pandemic started, I drove my last passenger on 11 March 2020, as I have the care of a parent susceptible with underlying health conditions. Nothing since.

The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is one of the largest hospitals in the county. It has an ER, trauma ward, and an separate outpatient entry that you can drive up to and drop someone off.




Or pick them up.

On the morning of Monday 24 August 2020, the Wife took my vehicle to work, as She had to pick up a friend of the family, a patient of the hospital, at the end of the day. A patient losing to cancer.

The Wife turns into the hospital grounds and pulls up in the loading zone in front of Out Patients. She puts the vehicle in park and before She can turn the engine off, the back door opens.

""Hi, I'm Jake.""

Wife turns around and looks Jake in the eye and says ""You've got the wrong car, Jake.""

Jake looks down at his phone and then back at my Wife.

""Can't you take me anyway, you're an Uber.""

Wife calmly explains that She is not an Uber driver, and asks Jake to exits the car. Jake steps out ...and before he can close the door, a woman holds the door open and asks ""Are you my Uber?""

Wife explains that She is not an Uber, and gets some opposition back from the female.

""If you're not here for me, then why are you here with the Uber signs?""

Wife, recognizing the ""entitled millennium"" attitude prevalent in so many people says ""I'm not your Uber,"" and calmly presses the door lock as the woman closes the rear door.

Wife pulls out her cell phone to text the patient that She is present outside the doors, and that She is in my vehicle with extra leg room...and room for their wheelchair.

As She is texting, a second guy (now the third person) comes up to the front passenger door and tries to open the (locked) door. The passenger swings their cell phone around to show Wife the passenger app, and even sitting across the vehicle, She can see that the passengers driver is still three minutes away...in their silver Prius.

""Look at your app, you've got the wrong car,"" she yells at him without unlocking the doors. The male person turns the cell phone back to themselves, sees the error of their ways, and backs away gesturing an apology.

After texting the patient, Wife reports She sat for about ten minutes waiting for a response. The Patients chemotherapy was wearing Him down so we knew that schedules had to be flexible. During that time Wife had two more people wandering about, heads down looking at their cell phone in the palm of their hand. She watched as they went back and forth before approaching the vehicle and attempting to enter the rear door. Neither of them walked to the driver side to approach my Wife.

With time to spare waiting for the patients, She presses the on board link to telephone me.

""I'm never driving your car again.""

Quickly I run through the back of mind about my car. Oil change not due. AC recharged two weeks ago. Sirius XM reprogrammed so Her favorite station is on the first list of favorites.

""Is there something wrong?"" I ask.

""Yeah. Everyone coming out of the hospital thinks I'm their Uber.""

I look at the clock - it 5pm. Both outpatients and business day employees are leaving. I laugh and explain to her that every passenger has at least seven different pieces of information to identify their Uber, including the license plate and the driver photo.

She asks ""Then why do they keep coming up to me?""

""Passengers are morons,"" I deliver previously unknown information. ""There was a young girl who failed to check her Uber's ID before getting in, and unfortunately lost her life.""

She questions the intelligence of the Human Race by asking ""Are people really that stupid?""

""People are morons,"" I respond, not missing a beat.

Wife reports on the earlier passengers. At this location, there I is a dedicated Uber/Lyft zone outside this hospital entrance and I ask if She's parked in it. She reports that She's not in the zone, but can see that it is about three vehicle spaces in front of her, where a white Honda Accord is parked.

""So, you're parked between the hospital doors and the Uber zone, near the Vallet podium?"" I ask.

""How did you know that,"" She inquires.

I'd been there enough on both pick up and drop offs that I said the valet should be getting ready to go home at 5:15pm.

""He just walked off now,"" She informed me.

I tell her that the app has dedicated locations to pick up passengers, and that that location where She is parked, is where the app tells passengers their Uber is. It's not where the actual pick up location is.

""It's thirty feet. Are you telling me that people won't walk thirty feet to get into the correct Uber?""

""People are morons,"" I tell her again. ""They're so wrapped up in themselves and oblivious to the outside world that they fail to assess the potential threats around them. They will get into a car, any car, thinking that it's their Uber, because they don't consider that an Uber could be for anyone but them. And if they're really entitled, when they realize their error, they'll respond aggressively - as though it's your fault.""

I hear the sound of my Wife unlocking the doors of the car, followed by the sound of a door opening. I hear a voice, an voice unknown to me.

""Hi there. Downtown to 5th Avenue please. Take the 5, it's quicker.""

Another passenger has entered and is giving directions. I already know this is going to go bad.

My Wife turns back to continue our telephone discussion and says ""What's Uberspeak for Get The #### Out Of My Car?""

I paused, confused until She says ""Another moron just got into the car.""

""Hey,"" the unknown voice responds. ""You can't speak to me like that, I'll one star you.""

The thing about red heads having a fiery temper- all true. My Wife has the sweetest smile I've ever seen, but it hides a savage mouth. I heard profanity, raised voices and at least one threat to tear lungs out, before the door closed and the vehicle was quiet for a moment.

""####, people really are morons,"" She said exasperated. ""How do you do it?""

""Not like that,"" I said.

She continues to report on the last passenger.

""WTF? The guy just got into the white Accord and has left. Your car looks nothing like an Accord.""

I can't take it further before the hospital staff arrive, our friend in the wheelchair. I stay on the phone as I listen to them load him in the car. He sounds...bad. The Wife gets back in the car and starts it.

""I have the correct passenger,"" She announces, and I can hear the calmness back in her voice. We hang up.

When She eventually arrives home, I'm still trying to scheme how I can turn Her next hospital run into cancellation fees.",2020

post-6451722,Young Kim,"Aug 16, 2020 at 6:37 AM","I just finished my long Saturday night shift and wished to share how every time I see 3:36 am cross my phone screen on a Saturday night I get chills. A couple of years ago in August, I had my most memorable (painful Saturday night) Ubering. At 3:36 am, I was picking up a passenger off the 94 and Fullerton in Chicago, and got a call from a good friend, ""V"". In a panicked voice, she said ""S"" took too much heroin and was passed out (""V"" and ""S"" were dating and living together). They had a one year old baby at the apartment. She asked me to stop working and drive up to Lake Bluff, IL to help her. I told her ,""NO! Call 911!!"" She refused because she was also taking heroin and didn't want the police involved. I explained to her that I am in the city, working Uber, and the drive was 40 minutes north, and she should call the police and ambulance.

She again refused (I didn't actually know their apartment address, so I demanded that she call). She countered with ""PLEASE DON'T, I THINK THAT ""S"" is fine, but he has fallen asleep and I need you to come her and help me take care of him!"" and told me that she thought that ""S"" had just fallen asleep and is now OK. I told her to put the phone by his mouth so I could hear his breathing. He seemed to be breathing fine. I asked her to see if he had a pulse, and she said the pulse was normal. I cancelled my pickup and logged off. And started to drive to Lake Bluff.

After I got there, I entered the apartment... she opened the door and ""S"" was sitting up on the floor leaning against the couch. I thought he was fine, I could hear him breathing quietly. So I walked up to him and said, ""Hey bro, wake up! I'm here now to take care of you"". As I touched his skin, it was cold and clammy. I opened his eyes... and that is when I felt a chill go up my spine that cemented that moment as the . His ... I immediately yelled at her to call 911! And she did. I proceeded to give him CPR, while he kept vomiting in my mouth. I finally stopped once the police and ambulance arrived, and they took over. ""S"" had overdosed, and was dying.

They had found a pulse, stabilized him, and then left. I stayed and left a statement. ""S"" died three days later after being in a coma, but the hospital said I kept him alive long enough for them to stabilize him and give the family hope (his organs were donated). Both ""S"" and ""V"" were my good friends. Years ago, I met them through a mutual friend. I personally never had done dope, never will, and grimace even more whenever I hear of anyone abusing drugs. (One thing I realized that when she had sat him up on the couch thinking this positioning would help him, it actually ended up making him choke on his own vomit. She was supposed to lay him on his left side). ""V"" was not arrested but she had her child taken away and went to a group home. That night of doing Uber... that Saturday night. Now, on a Saturday night...whenever I see 3:36 am pass on my app... I get a chill... and pain that never goes away.

(screenshot tonight at 3:36 am... I always mentally freeze every Saturday night, at 3:36 am).

post-6323473,El Janitor,"Jun 21, 2020 at 10:44 PM","I haven't been driving UBER as much. Right now I can't because someone I live with could die if they get COVID-19 so no passengers for awhile. I have been doing some Eats, but thankfully I was able to get another job so I don't have to rely solely on UBER. I also want to say, I am not above driving for a living, but at times I'm happy I don't have to do it so much.

Some drivers solely rely on driving for a living, I know it can be stressful, I've done it myself. There's good days and bad days, and then there's bad passengers. I remember getting in my car, and one guy hadn't showered in a few days, I was happy when I dropped him off. I had one passenger get crazy over differences in the way we lived our lives, I was happy when I dropped him off. I've had people vape in my car without asking, and then try to play stupid when I said something to them about it nicely. I've had a few passengers who worried me a little and was also happy when I dropped them off. However for the most part the majority of my passengers have been normal people who go from A to B, and to be honest the're the best customers. Pick up, drop off no issues, they respect me and my car and we're done. Love to have you again anytime.

However there's the bad passengers. It's a whole spectrum of people who for whatever reason can't drive and need a ride somewhere but they just can't get in sit quietly and be dropped off. I've read the stories on this site and I can relate to a few of them. Some passengers do drive, but for whatever reason they need a ride somewhere, but they just can't seem to be respectful to the driver. They need to let you know that they are superior to you, and try to make you feel small. Or they think you're stupid, or whatever is going on in their head and they just can't accept the fact they they need you to take them somewhere, and be happy you are there to do that.

I'm a car guy, I love cars always have. I used to enjoy fixing mt car etc etc etc. To this day I enjoy my car. If you're going to get into my car respect it. I keep it clean, and I keep it up and I'm sharing it with you. I don't smoke so don't smoke in my car. Don't vape, don't do drugs, and please eat before you request a ride or after I drop you off. I've seen the complaints from passengers and I know that some drivers have dirty cars, etc etc and aren't the nicest people. However some of the passenger stories are just entitled garbage. Drivers put high miles on their cars and make little pay. Some drivers have educations and job skills that the passengers have no clue about. Some of them are doing this so their family won't get evicted etc.. Not everyone has a smooth life, think before you speak.

So in conclusion and I stand by this if you don't like UBER, Lyft, if your Rolls Royce Limo broke down and you are just disgusted at the fact that you need to call an UBER, be thankful you aren't on the bus.I'm happy to drop you at a bus stop and you can GTFO. I'm sure someone on the bus will want to spark up an interesting conversation with you. Hopefully it's about how the aliens in frying pans took their dog, and raped the ducks and you're one of them and there on to you because they know you come from quack quack! Seriously enjoy that. There's so many fun things about the bus, but if you don't like the bus there's always cabs. Cabs charge double or triple what your UBER ride would be, and well you can roll the dice to see how well maintained the cab is.

For whatever reason a passenger needs a ride they need to be respectful of the driver and their vehicle. It should be mutual, and if at the very least all you need to do is confirm who you are and where you are going, and ask the driver if they are who it says on your app. You can sit quietly and enjoy the scenery as it goes by, and wait till you get to your destination. It's just that simple, if you like the service you can leave a tip, we like tips, if we made you happy. Rideshare is so much nicer then the bus, all you have to do is be nice and respectful.",2020
post-6618334,UberUKdriver,"Nov 7, 2020 at 8:13 PM","I picked up this rider 2 months ago and got the ping to pick the same pax up again I remember the last time that they took a while to come out, but didn't say anything to alarm me in the previous ride ,so I thought it seemed a safe.

I got the ping and arrived within 3 minutes, I noticed for some reason I was being given the death stare by the pax, so the pax gets in I greet the pax, confirm name and destination and I set off.

I drive straight on and I come to a stop at a set of traffic lights, the lights turn green and I drive on and there are two trucks in the left lane in front of me at the next set of lights, lights turn green I indicate to overtake them in the right lane and then promptly move back into the left lane, so I come to a standstill at the next set of lights and anticipating to move into the right lane, I switch the indicator on....and *poke-slap* from behind my pax startles me! I turn around with shock as to wtf just happened!?

I ask the pax why did you do that? and I get cut off with ""Why did you *##*### bring me this way"" and ""You're getting me late for work"", bare in mind the pax has only been in my car for just over 2 minutes, I take deep breaths and tell the pax I'm cancelling the ride. I pull up outside a bar the pax starts raising their voice & shouting and I tell the pax to get out of my car. I'm still in shock as to why the pax thought they could assault me.

Today Uber died - drowned in a sea of ants almost from the getgo, I gave just 4 rides totaling $32 between 0445 and 0830 - miserable results. I wasn't being real choosy, either - normally I get kicked off Uber 3-4 times per morning for hat trick declines, but not at all today. I don't know who kicked the ant hill, but they were both early and everywhere.

At any rate, starved but not ready to throw in the towel, I opened Lyft...surprise - I made more with Lyft during the normally dead 9-11 AM than I made with Uber all morning.

However, during the past 3 weeks, I've given out just one mask (provided by Uber) to a rider who didn't have one but was happy to wear one. Today, in the course of 5-6 Lyft rides I had to give away TWO Uber masks as well as cope with a lovely lady who took her mask off (to eat) as well as threw her trash out my window...I rarely award a One-Star, but she earned hers!",2020
post-5966086,Benjamin M,"Mar 9, 2020 at 7:39 PM","Second time that I have taken a ""service animal"", some lap dog that clearly has no training or indication at all of performing a service.

Pulled up to the address, they waved me into the driveway. Pax was in a foldable motorized wheelchair.

Hopped out to load it (unsure at first if it would even fit) and all of the sudden two dogs are walking around me. A fluffy lap dog of some sort and a pit mix - whatever, they were chill. Nobody really spoke English. Airport trip.

As I am loading the chair into the trunk, I notice that my front passenger door is open and the small dog is standing on the seat.

""Umm.. Is the dog going with us?""

""Oh, yes, yes. Service dog!"" Riiiiiight. I bite my tongue but ask that they please make him stop climbing on the seat back and such. Then ""oh sorry, he training"". So, which is it?

The dog barely followed simple commands, let alone advanced training to be a service animal, was not on a leash (none visible), and did not have a vest or anything indicating it was a service animal.

Then I ask the pax to sit in the back seat and put the dog on the floor. Had to repeat that several times. Finally, ""oh, no. He more comfortable there"". Fine, whatever.

The pax managed to keep the dog between his legs on the floor during the trip, I said absolutely nothing apart from asking what airline he was flying.

Dropped him off, pulled out his heavy chair without assistance, assembled it, slid his bag in its compartment as requested, and wished him a great day. Rated 5*.

post-6652852,Benjamin M,"Nov 27, 2020 at 7:47 PM","It has been brutally slow here lately. My first hour out, I made $10. Things were getting better around 4pm but I had about had it for the day.

Accepted a ping, and it was an odd one. I was asked to transport an ""air mattress"" (which was actually an inflatable hospital mattress from a nursing home) rather than a pax with a promise of a ""big tip"" - trip was about 35 minutes.

The rest is outlined below in an email. ""I'll tip you in the app"" lie for this? Shame on me for believing that and taking this trip, although it was actually the most profitable of the day.

Elazar has some explaining to do.

Good evening,

At 1539 I accepted a trip request on the Uber platform. Immediately after, I received a message that I would be transporting an ""air mattress"" rather than a passenger, sent by a gentleman named Elazar at the <redactated> location.

Not knowing that I was to transport more than a typical ""air mattress"" but rather a large inflatable hospital mattress from a nursing facility, I agreed.

I hesitated to complete the trip but trips were scarce due to low demand and Elazar promised a ""big tip"". And, upon dropping off the mattress (taken from my trunk by staff wearing PPE), he reiterated that he would tip me - and in fact said he was doing so at that very moment.

As I returned to the city, it became clear that I was not tipped, rather was lied to in order to accept transportation of a possibly hazardous piece of medical equipment - something that is absolutely not part of the Uber platform in Richmond (or delivering anything other than food).

I called the <redacted> facility and they were apologetic and offered me a cash tip of $10 but by that point it was not worth the time, miles, tolls, or effort - Elazar was the account holder and should be responsible. I also called <redacted> and left a message.

Ironically, during ten years of service as a Paramedic, I transported patients to and from both facilities. And I expected better.

UberX is not a delivery service, period. To then blatantly lie about compensation for such a request is reprehensible.

I hope that Elazar remains true to his word (perhaps inform him that drivers know if we have been tipped or not) and that neither facility utilizes rideshare platforms in this manner ever again.

I would appreciate to hear from management, my phone number is <redacted>, best time to reach me is after noon.

Attached are details of the trip (including trip summary with no tip and mention of the air mattress - tipping was mentioned on the phone), audio and video recording is also available.

Thank you,

I snapped the photos for uber... I really really could not tell what was going to happen from how she walked in ...she seemed fine as she approached the car before the ride started... Right now I feel so sad for her...",2020
post-6337618,goneubering,"Jun 28, 2020 at 2:09 AM","I pulled up to the house in a nice neighborhood and waited a few minutes until a middle aged lady walked very slowly to my car. It took her a minute or two just to sit down and buckle up then she asked me to take her to the hospital. She quickly claimed she wasn’t contagious but she clearly was in a seriously weakened condition. 

I didn’t ask her what was wrong but in my mind I was wondering if she would make it to the hospital alive. When we arrived at the ER I got out and opened her door. I offered to walk her into the hospital but she refused. I stayed in the drop off zone until I saw her safely enter the hospital. Then she dropped down to one knee inside the entrance. A security guard quickly brought her a wheelchair so I left.

This was several months ago before the Covid virus was well known or anyone was wearing masks.

I wonder why she used Uber instead of calling an ambulance? I suppose it was because of the cost. I hope the hospital was able to help her. She said she had been there many times.",2020
post-6514190,Young Kim,"Sep 14, 2020 at 6:41 PM","Had a pax, last ride of the night, pickup around Lincoln Ave and Austin Ave in Morton Grove, IL. Destination was a factory by O'Hare airport. Again, once I develop a solid rapport, I ask gently about their lives (if it seems that they wish to share). She seemed totally normal (affable, funny) and said she takes an Uber often. When I asked if she drives, she replied that she has gotten 6...yes 6...DUIs. But she is still driving! She cannot drive now because of an accident which totaled her car. It was by a bar, and she destroyed her car. The car was her brother's who let her use it (even though she had no driver's license). After the accident, she turned the corner and took off running by foot. She said it did NOT involve another car, so there was nobody around. The next day, the car was impounded and her brother took the blame and notified police. He said the car was totaled, and he had no phone or way to call the towing place, so he walked home. The pax (his sister), said she was drinking, so that is why she fled the accident scene. 

She seemed to be in her mid to late forties, and said she developed a drinking problem as a teenager. And one after another, she got those DUIs. I wished to share this because this is probably the biggest number I had heard of. I have had a couple say that they got two DUIs, and after the 2nd they learned their lesson well. But she said her drinking issue was just so difficult, that the problem spanned decades. And naturally after the 2nd, she started to do some jail time. We both didn't think that a judge would ever let her get her license back. She said that once she gets a new car, she may continue to risk driving, but I advised her not to. Especially with her history, I am worried that if she is caught driving again (since she has no driver's license), it may mean instant jail time. 

I hoped she took my advice. She had no kids or husband... She was quite nice and tipped me $5 in cash at the end, in part because I gave her a light for her cigarette that she desperately wanted to smoke before she started her shift. I remember the end of the ride was funny because I accidentally drove onto a lawn instead of the roundabout where her factory door entrance was, and she laughed so much and remarked that the security guard will likely tease her (and me her Uber driver), for making such a mistake (it was hard to distinguish the grass from the driveway at the time). Anyhow, I was shocked that my pax didn't learn after say the second DUI. I noted to myself that a lot of Uber rides at night are selected from drivers without licenses.",2020
post-6657929,Electorite,"Dec 1, 2020 at 8:48 AM",I drive people for Uber and I deliver Uber Eats. I got a warning for not wearing a mask on an Uber Eats delivery but I was wearing a mask. As I was walking up to the house I put my mask on. She started out hostile on the phone and the instructions had me call her and I'm always very professional. It was in the worst part of Philadelphia that I was delivering and I fear that if I get another report of not wearing a mask I will get fired from Uber like a friend did two years ago for getting reported for drinking three times even though she never drinks. There really needs to be some oversight with these complaints because customers can simply report things that are erroneous and get drivers fired. This isn't fair. There should be some actual proof or the customer should take a picture before a driver actually gets fired for not wearing mask Outdoors,2020

post-6309364,Haanjo,"Jun 15, 2020 at 3:29 PM","Just sent this message to Lyft yesterday, but they didn't respond, and because it has now been more than 24 hours since I sent my message, I don't think they will respond. Having said that, I thought I would share this with the forum, as it will give most Uber / Lyft drivers with a sense of humor a good laugh, as I'm sure you will be able to relate to it....... 

ESCALATION REQUEST

Today I received an email message for Lyft indicating my driver account was flagged and that I could be deactivated due to too many cancellations. I would like to respond to this message and explain some of the reasons why I cancel. I hope that after a Lyft manager has had a chance to review this message, that the flag will be lifted from my account.

First of all I'd like to point out that I have over 2,340 rides with a perfect 5.0 rating. That's a lot of rides, and passengers I give rides to usually give me good ratings.

Usually, if a passenger has a bad experience with me, its because of something they did and not me. Now, I don't know who has complained about me. Perhaps people have complained about me because I cancelled their ride. Let me explain why I do this sometimes:

I would say the number one reason I cancel a ride is because the rider doesn't show up. In most of these cases, I've waited 5 minutes or more for the passenger to show up, even if they send me a message that says, ""I'm coming"" or ""Be right there"". In my experience, usually, when a passenger says, ""I'm coming"" or ""be right there"", what they really mean is that they are not ready and are not coming, and will not arrive until after you have waited 5 minutes. This is a common scenario, where people basically tell you they will be right out, but aren't ready when they say they will be...when they know the clock is ticking down. Is it so unreasonable to cancel their rides after waiting 5 minutes?

There are other reasons I may cancel on a rider after I've waited 5 minutes. For instance, just last week, after I arrived to a passengers pick up location, he called me to let him know that I was at the Kum and Go gas station, so I drove to the Kum and Go to Meet him. Of course, no one was there waiting for me, the 5 minute mark had already passed, I waited for him for an additional 2 minutes, and because I didn't see anyone, I cancelled, but not before driving back to the original pickup point, because Lyft has a policy of not giving me a $5 cancellation fee unless I drive back to the original location, even if I have waited 7 minutes, even when the passenger told me to meet him at a new pickup location...but didn't show up. Is this unreasonable?

Let me tell you another reason I recently cancelled on a passenger. I was on my way to pick up a passenger after accepting a ride. As I was about 5 minutes away, I received a text message from the passenger asking if his LAWN MOWER would fit in my car. Now, I don't know about you, but if you have ever used a lawn mower, they can get very dirty, shed grass everywhere, and smell like gas. Who wants to have someone's lawn mover in their car? Would you? Neither would I, so I cancelled.

Sometimes, I cancel, because someone is covered in puke when I arrive. You know, I drive for Lyft, using my own car. I'm not a health care worker. I don't like my car smelling like vomit. Would you pick up a passenger covered in vomit, or would you cancel? In one instance, I showed up to pick up a passenger, who's friend was vomiting. She was nice enough to have a small plastic container for her passenger to puke in after she got in my car, but have you ever seen someone puke? Its usually a pretty violent action, and people certainly aim their puke in a particular direction, let alone how much of it will come out. Would you pick up that passenger, knowing that they might miss the little plastic containing and puke all over your car, or would you cancel?

I once even had a passenger show up with his passenger, who was a young woman who could barely walk (truthfully, she flopped around like a fish), and he was holding a TRASH BAG as they stumbled along and approached my car. I actually DID pick them up, and miraculously, she didn't puke during the ride. But you know what I should have done? I SHOULD HAVE cancelled as soon as I saw the plastic bag and the woman flopping around like a fish.

But you know what? Not wanting to get puke in my car isn't the only reason I cancel on passengers. I will admit it that even though I try to avoid picking up passengers in neighborhoods where I might get shot, I have still risked my safety to pick up many people in these neighborhoods. But here is what really stinks...

Let's say I'm 20 minutes away from a passenger, who lives in a bad neighborhood, where I might get shot, but just for the heck of it, I decide to drive there anyway to pick up the passenger. Well, in one case, I was on my way to pick up a beautiful girl we will just call Angel. Even though my car might get shot up and that I might die on my way to pick up Angel, who cares, because Angel seemed she might be a pretty cool person that I could have a great conversation with...in the event I lived to pick her up. Well, after surviving the 20 minute ride there, about three minutes away from meeting Angel, the unthinkable happened. I hear the Lyft Robot voice, who sounds like a psycho killer say,

""Lyft Pickup Change""

You know what? It really stinks when you risk your life to drive 20
minutes to pick up Angel, and get a Lyft pickup change notice just as you are about to arrive...and instead of picking up Angel, a smelly dude we will just call Earl, who hasn't changed his underwear for a week, is waiting for you. How would you feel in that situation? Maybe you love the smell of farts, and would drive 20 minutes to pick up Earl, but in my case, I didn't accept that ride on the other side of town and risk my life to pick up Earl. Would you cancel?

That's actually a true story, although the names have been changed to protect those involved, and truthfully, I can't remember if I cancelled on smelly Earl or not. But the point is, a driver may accept or deny a ride for variety of reasons, whether those reasons are valid or not, and yes, I'm aware that you can't discriminate against anyone for any reason. Yet, if I accept a ride request for whatever reason, and Lyft changes that ride on me without giving me a chance to accept or deny that ride, I'm fully justified, as a driver, who is an independent contractor and not an employee of Lyft, to cancel that ride.

On that note, there is another issue here that Lyft needs to address, and that is rides that are placed in a driver's queue automatically, which the driver does not have the ability to accept or deny.

Now, if a driver cancels a ride in his or her queue, as long as that ride is cancelled before the rider drops off his current passenger, that cancellation is not counted against him. Please note that I'm going to keep using the word ""he"" here because I'm a dude (but not as smelly as the mythical Earl), and that yes, I realize that there are female drivers too, who do a great job driving for Lyft, even when they have to pick up smelly ""dudes"" like me and Earl.

That being said, when it gets busy, and ride requests come in one after the other, especially now while the Covid 19 virus is floating around, and there are WAY less drivers out there than there used to be, it can be very difficult to cancel ride request as they come in, and keep in mind, many of these are usually quite literally 19 minutes away, and on the other side of town, and since Lyft DOESN'T PAY ME to drive 19 minutes away to pick them up, I decline many of these rides when I can, because who wants to drive 19 minutes and not get paid for it? Would you?

Well, what often happens is that even if you, as a driver, decline every 19 minutes away ride request that comes in, while your current ride is ending, another ride often gets placed in your queue, and you, as a driver, can't do anything to decline it except cancel it, when it automatically loads as the next ride. In fact, the only thing you can do, as a driver, in these circumstances to block the rides from coming in is to Turn On Last Ride, but the problem is, because you don't ever have the option of declining these rides, and because you, as a driver, have to cancel them, these unwanted rides get counted against you. This can easily happen 5 to 10 times a DAY! Is it fair for Lyft to penalize GOOD drivers like me, to be forced to accept then cancel rides that are 19 minutes away, that Lyft won't pay me for, and then threaten me to deactivate my driver account when I cancel these rides?

That's why I would really like someone on Lyft's management team to review this message, and consider making changes to the Lyft system. In a typical busy Friday or Saturday night of driving, my Lyft cancellations for rides I cancelled might look something like this:

1 Smelly Earl Lyft Pickup Change Cancellation
3 No Show Cancellations
1 Puke Cancellation
1 Unsafe Area Cancellation
5 Cancellations that I did not have the option to decline that were put in my queue as a ride was ending

If you add up the numbers, you get the potential of about 11 driver cancellations a day that are completely justifiable. Sure, these aren't exact numbers, and sure, there are many other reasons a driver may cancel, most of which are justified, and a small minority which may not be justified. That being said, when I cancel a ride, for any reason, in my view, I have very good reasons to do so. Now that Lyft has a better understanding of why some drivers cancel rides, especially some of my reasons for cancelling, I hope that Lyft would consider making at least some changes, especially when the driver cancels rides that are added to his queue as a ride is ending, that he does not have the option to decline.

One final note: I really like driving for Lyft, and I hope I have served Lyft well. Lyft's customer service representatives are always helpful when I have to write you guys (and gals) with problems. As much as I like Lyft, and have attempted to use humor when writing this message (I never actually took a wiff of fat Earl, although at times, I wonder if some of my passengers know what a shower or bath is), I want to remind Lyft that I'm not an employee, and that I'm an independent contractor, and have the Constitutional right to love, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that means making my own, independent decisions about why I may cancel a ride.

The Final Word:

At least show drivers what their cancellation rate is, so that they can keep track of that metric and try to lower it using actual data, rather than trying to guess what that number is, or how far over that undefined threshold will cause them to get deactivated as drivers. I'm sure Lyft has a building full of Lawyers, but ride share companies do get taken to court, which could result in millions of dollars in damages if a judge rules against Lyft in a class action lawsuit for wrongful termination of independent contractors. Just think how much money Lyft could save by taking my advice in this message. You are welcome, Lyft. As always, keep up the good work, and please remove the flag on my account due to too many cancellations, as flagging my account for this reason is totally unfair.

Love,

Keith",2020

post-6592353,Boca Ratman,"Oct 26, 2020 at 3:13 PM","I get a ping, 45+. I accepted, shortly after I received a phone call that I was delivering an envelope. Account holder called back, asked me to wait a few minutes. 

I figured sure, I set lyft to the city of the destination and waited. A few a few minutes later an elderly woman came outside, she seemed angry and anxious and wanted to know why I was in front of her house. I explained, who I was. I asked if she was okay, she said no. 

She was on the phone with someone, obviously uncomfortable with the situation. This made me uncomfortable, with the situation. I asked her what was going on, she wouldn't tell me. 

At this point my spider senses are screaming at me. I stuck around out of concern for the little old lady and also for selfish reasons. The potential of double dipping on a lyft fare and an uber fare plus I need to head down to near that city (65 miles away) for something. 

She went in the house and came back out, I was half expecting the cops to show up any minute. She told me to wait a minute she had to get it ready to transport. She comes out with some papers and a manilla envelope. I asked if I could look inside before I took it. She was very hesitant but then handed me the papers and the envelope and told me to go ahead and count it. 

Brake screech! 

Count it? Wtf? I felt the envelope, felt like two bundles of cash. I asked her if she just handed me cash and again asked if she was all right. She just said no but wouldn't talk to me. 

I started the trip and Googled the address. it was a shopping center in S FL. I handed her the papers and envelope back and told her this doesn't feel right at all. Her neighbor came outside and she called him over, younger guy 35-40. She still wouldn't talk to me but was talking to him within earshot of me, I could hear most of the conversation. 

She had received a call from her grandson. He'd been arrested, blah blah. As soon as I heard that it all clicked. The neighbor knew too, and told me to go. I wanted to make sure the woman knew they were trying to scam her, so I stuck around a few minutes. 

I never looked at the papers or opened the envelope. I let uber know it was a scam account, they haven't replied yet. I am hesitant about cling the police or the critical uber line, knowing uber my account gets deactivated. I told her to call the police and the neighbor said he'd look after her. 

Its an old scam, apparently still effective. I heard her tell the neighbor there was $8,500 in cash and a cashier's check for $10,000 in the envelope. 

I ended the trip, i should have driven to the location or at least half way. Oh well, at least grandma didn't lose all that money.",2020

Here is the story explaining why I gave him 3 stars. Soon after I received a request from Ryan who lives in a luxurious apartment complex, he called me to ask if I could drive to his building. He said it was not a big deal if I didn't wanted to but he needed some time to walk to the front gate. I agreed and then he told me the gate code and directions to his building. Everything sounds fine until I arrived.

This is the first time ever that a passenger signals for a hand shake. Awkward enough, instead of a brief one, he rubbed my hand with his left hand and said ""how come you are so soft and smooth?"" I withdrew my hand immediately and told him that the trunk was ready for his 2 large pieces of luggage. Apparently, he did not get the sign that I was not in the mood for a conversation after giving him minimal replies to the usual questions like ""what do you do?"" and ""how do you like driving Uber?.

He then asked me the brand of hand-cream, shampoo, body wash and perfume that I use. I told him that those questions were too personal. He apologized and said the questions were asked out of curiosity, thinking it would be nice if his wife could use the same products. The 30-minute drive in general was uneventful. As usual, I popped the trunk and stepped aside for him to unload at the terminal. He put forward his hand again but sorry not another time. I then declined politely with a smile and said "" have a good day and enjoy your flight, sir.""

How often do your passengers ask for a hand shake? I do feel it is NOT necessary and appropriate at all.",2020
post-6657998,CocaColaKid,"Dec 1, 2020 at 9:49 AM","So, get a ping 4 min away for a 10 min ride to pick up Shannon.

I pull into the lot, and there are a male and female standing there waiting. Names are confirmed and she gets in. I swipe start UberX and it requests a PIN. I ask Shannon for her PIN and she has no idea what I am talking about. I explain this randomly happens, she just needs to look in her app. She cant find it.

No problem... I hit ""Rider cant find PIN"" and it asks for the last 4 digits of her phone number. That doesn't work either. At this point I learn that Shannon has took many Uber trips and has never had to do this before, like I'm getting a kick out of this. Her friend starts telling me that she is having a bad day, and just to drive them.

I show them my screen, I enter the number in front of them, ride won't start. She shows me the phone number in the app (The last 4 match what we were entering) and I see myself as her driver, so I know this isn't a scam... its an Uber f--k up. 

I tell them I can't do anything at this point, and that's when Shannon demands her money back. I explain I've been paid nothing, and will get nothing until the ride starts... so she needs to contact Uber Support. The passenger tells me that I'm being a dick and getting one star'd for this trip. Well, at this point, I'm not doing the trip even if the PIN showed up on her phone. They were told to exit the vehicle, which they did, leaving both back doors wide open.

I accelerate heavily and the doors close. I U-turn back towards the entrance/exit and the ""PIN required"" disappears. I stop somewhat near the passengers and she starts yelling at me that she isn't going to pay a cancellation fee. No problem, I let her know, I'll cancel on my side and she can make a new request.

post-6410117,LyftUberFuwabolewa,"Jul 29, 2020 at 9:33 PM","So I get a ghetto XL ping… Ghetto XL rides are the worst. Usually they are requesting an XL ride because they have a whole herd of little kids with no car seats, or they have more people that can even fit in an XL ride, or they have a huge pile of stinky laundry in giant cloth bags to go to the laundromat.

As soon as I accept I go ahead and text “Due to the virus I can only carry up to five passengers. All passengers must be wearing facemasks. Any children that require car seats according to state law must have car seats.”

I get no answer nor cancellation. I arrived at the pick up and guess what I’m greeted by? A woman carrying a one-year-old with no car seat!

“Hi. Good afternoon. Is the child going? How old is the child? Do you have a car seat? I’m sorry I can’t take a child without a car seat. It’s against state Law and against company policy”.

Angry look (This isn’t her first rodeo) and a snippy “go ahead and cancel then”. 

As I wait out the timer she toddles off into the house.

I have the message about only carrying five passengers, facemasks are required as our car seats for children saved. When I get a ghetto XL ride I text the message right away.

So far it's not helped. Even though people have kids with no car seats or more passengers than I can carry they don't cancel the ride. I did have one lady text back and say ""no car seats"". Sure enough when I got to the pick up there she was with tiny tots and no car seats.

I guess I need to add to my note that if you can't comply with those three points that they should go ahead and cancel the ride. 

When I get a no-show rider or I have to cancel for too many passengers or no car seats I consider it ghetto tips.",2020
post-6627219,touberornottouber,"Nov 12, 2020 at 11:35 AM","I'm in FL on the east coast so we are getting a lot of rain from the tropical storm. I get a request about mile away. Uber says it is a four minute trip (oh great!). After about a minute of driving the pax calls me and says the address is wrong and then tells me he doesn't need a ride. He just wants me to jump start his car so he can get to work.

I politely explain that we are just here to drive people and that I can't jump start his car. I don't even have jumper cables. He tells me he has some. I again tell him that we are not here to do that and that I would gladly drive him to work if he wants. He continues trying to get me to jump start his car. I finally tell him, ""No, especially not in the pouring rain. We're just not here to do that. Youshould probably call AAA or someone like that to help you do that.""

Customer pauses for a couple seconds and then tells me he is going to physically assault me if he sees me. I tell him that I am going to call the police right now. He hangs up. Cancels the ride. I write a message into Uber about the guy and tell them they should pull the call to listen for themselves.

These riders are getting pretty crazy. No, I'm not going to jump start your car in the pouring rain for $3. For those who don't know jumpstarting cars can damage your vehicle. You have no idea what is wrong with the other person's vehicle. If you really want to help jumpstart cars you should get one of those separate instant boosters which use their own battery.

Phone rings while I am in there. Its DoorDash support. I do not answer it because at the moment, I am working for number two (whose number two working for?). Phone rings again. Still I did not answer it. I then set the app to no more delivery offers and shut it off. I concluded what I thought was a great accomplishment which deserves a lifetime toilet achievement award then head out to grab the order. The girl who gives me the order said that DoorDash support called because the customer had a change in the order but that they took care of it and was all set.

I get in my car and start to route and the phone rings again. Its DoorDash support. I answer and the rep tells me the order was changed but they talked to Chipotle and it was taken care of. Then they asked me where I was. I told them that not that it was any of their business but the order was not ready when I arrived so I used the bathroom. She goes on with, ""Well I tried to call you first several times. You must have been in there a long time. The merchant told me you were in the bathroom when I called"". So I am like, ""ok so what?"". Then the rep goes on about how I shouldn't delay the order and that I should go unavailable if I need to use the bathroom for an extended period of time. I asked her what she supposed I do if I am waiting for an order and she says I need to use better time management because it delayed the customer's order. I was thinking, the nerve of this person! She then says she has to call the customer about the delay and happy dashing. Ok?

I arrive at the customer's house and its a meet at the door delivery. They come to the door with a smile on their face. They said hello and said, ""Um someone from DoorDash called to tell me you were on the way and that there was a delay..... because you were in the bathroom for an extended period of time??"". I was shocked. I told them yes I was but the order was not ready when I arrived. The customer laughed and just told me it was funny DoorDash told them that.

After the delivery, I gave it some thought and I did not find it funny at all. Why is Chipotle telling DoorDash I am in the bathroom and why is DoorDash telling the customer that? Like WHAT THE HECK?????",2020
post-6649726,Benjamin M,"Nov 25, 2020 at 8:21 PM","Lately I have been getting a huge number of pings from JenCare Senior Medical Centers. 

Had one today that I had picked up previously, a very nice old man - that can barely walk, let alone get into and out of my Civic without assistance. 

It took him about six minutes to get into the car today, this time picking him up at his residence and taking him to the clinic. 

While I spent many years doing medical transport (Advanced Life Support and limited mobility BS runs and 911), me trying to assist someone with the possibility of them falling and breaking their hip for $3 (literally this fare) is not happening. 

Got to JenCare, told him to sit tight while I asked for help. A few minutes later, I was greeted by his actual physician, the receptionist, and a nurse - with a wheelchair. It took the three of them about another five minutes to get him out of the car. 

The doctor could not have been more understanding that this is unacceptable, promised that he would be transported in their wheelchair van from now on (parked right there). 

I explained that we get these pings like any other - we are NOT dedicated to medical transport, receive any sort of training, and that many drivers themselves may have physical limitations. She did not seem to understand that, nor do these pax, and thanked me for the information. 

This gentleman was actually going to the clinic because he had fallen and broken several bones - so, an Uber for a high fall risk patient? Triple bypass negative.

It's one thing if a passenger is handicap. It's another if insurance is paying for the trip and the more appropriate solution is a wheelchair van. 

Two pings later, pick up at an ER. Pax was standing with a staff member, no mask. Told the staff member that masks are required, so she went to get one - then dropped it and went for another. 

Meanwhile, the pax kept tugging on the locked door handle. I said three times that she needs a mask to enter. Then she says ""I'll ride in the trunk!"" and meant it. 

Pretty clear that this was a psych patient and I ""noped"" out with ""No mask or face covering"". 

An interesting thing about that ping was that there was an automatic text with an apartment number. I had the same last week in an apartment complex, apparently we are supposed to go directly to the apartment and assist the pax. Again, this is not medical transport. 

I appreciate that these are low income folks and RS is cheaper than medical transport. But I do not have a fancy stretcher, ambulance, or insurance for someone getting hurt. 

So, please, if you have one of these pax - speak up to the staff. The doctor was thankful for the information.",2020

The earnings estimate was from just below $300 to just above. Hell yeah, it was  like Donkey Kong. Then a call from the pax came through; the high value of the ping earned his call being answered by me.

- ""Hey bro, how would you like to earn some money tonight?""

A strange question, I thought. What other reason could there possibly be for me to be out here driving drunks around. Anyway, the images of what the work might entail were already taking turns presenting themselves inside of my head like a slide show. Drugs run? <Click> Dress up in gimp suit? <Click> Getaway driver?

Me - ""Doing what?""
Pax - ""I need you to drive me and my 6 bros to LA in my car. I'm trying to get my car back home. You could have one of your friends follow us in your car so you can get back here. How much do you want to do that? 400 bucks?""

Let's pause the anecdote to examine the pros and cons:

Pros:

400 bucks is on the table. It's a strong first offer. Dude sounds desperate. There'd likely be more money if pushed.

Cons:

It's a crew of 7 drunk dudes at 2:30 on a Saturday night, so you know it'd be an easy ride. :thumbup: What could possibly go wrong?

I was about to get over when this Range Rover sped up and thwarted my attempt . I got over once he passed and noticed right away that he had no license plate on the back.

The missing plate on this Range Rover made me reflect on my own recent stolen license plate nightmare. I also have a local friend who's plate was stolen this month.

I was behind the Range Rover for a good 30 seconds when he quickly passed two cars and I lost site for a few moments . I then changed lanes and caught up to his car.

At that point I observed that he somehow HAD A LICENSE PLATE on his car. WTF???? Am I losing my mind? I pulled up along side to see who's driving and low and behold ... It was Bruce Fricken Willis! You read that right.

He noticed I saw him and from that point on he wouldn't let me get along side to take a photo of him. I could only keep up from a few cars back.

When I got home I looked up License Plate Hiders and they are a real thing !!! It would make sense that a celebrity of his level would have a James Bondie device like that .

So I make sure it's where he wants to go. Then he says he wants me to wait & we're gonna p\u somebody else & go back.

Of course I tell him I ain't doing no r\t & he's better off just getting another Uber back. He insists on it & I tell him I ain't doing it. He says he's only gonna be a min. so I should wait. I tell him even if he does come back right away which most people don't, I still ain't doing it.

So he asks me why I don't wanna wait so I tell him I don't get paid for the return & I ain't working for free & Uber pays me crap anyways. So he gets this attitude but I tell him I ain't doing it. We're almost there by this time. So he asks what it's gonna take to get me to wait & I tell him I ain't answering that cause he'll complain & lie but I got a dashcam so if he tries it, I'll show he's a liar. So he takes out his wallet & gives me 2 Abes. OK, that'll buy ya 15 min.

So we get there & he goes inside this $ store & in like 2 min. he comes back out & he's walking real fast & these 2 guys are following him. 1 has this little camera & the other guy's waving a cell phone in his face. So he hurries up & gets back in my car & tells me to get outta there. I can't cause the guy w\the camera's in front of my car & the other guy's leaning up against it.

The guy w\the phone starts yelling real loud & asks me why I brought him to meet a 14 YO boy for hankkypanky. So I pointed to the Uber sign on my dash & told him I don't ask no pax why they want a ride, I just take 'em where the app says. So the guy w\the phone keeps asking me real loud if I knew he was coming here to meet a 14 YO boy meanwhile the guy in the back keeps telling me to drive and I keep telling him I can't run over the guy w\the camera who's standing in front of my car

Finally I tell these guys to get outta my way cause I'm about to start losing money. They get real loud about how. Don't I want preds. exposed & I should be glad & helping them out.........

So I tell them they got him on cam so they can go to the popo & the popo knows what he looks like & they got his phone# & they can show that to the popo & they know where & when he was in an Uber so they can show that to the popo so they can get the info from Uber about this guy. So I tell 'em to get outta my way & we're going. They get outta the way & we go. All the way back the guy's telling me it's BS & the t got the wrong guy & all that. I let him out where I picked him up & got outta there. I made a report to Uber & let 'em know I'm saving the dashcam footage.

TLDR-I got a ping to p\u a pedo who thought he was going to meet a boy & get his jollies but it turned out he got caught in a sting by 1 of those Youtube pedo. nabbers.

post-6648374,Ozzyoz,"Nov 24, 2020 at 10:57 PM","It is a funny story, but I picked up these young white couple (man and woman) in Uptown Minneapolis. (I normally don't have any issues with white folks in Uptown Minneapolis btw), Their destination was in downtown area which Lyndale directly connects to, but Lyndale has traffic jams sometimes so I avoid it. That was the time 36th was open before the current construction project on i35W Mouth into Minneapolis. So as I drove south bound towards 36th St. that had i35W North freeway entrance towards downtown, The woman nervously starting saying ""You're going opposite way of where we're going dude"". I sensed some fear in her when she said that, I then calmly told her ""I am trying to get on 36th so I can head towards downtown. And then they reminded me of that scary movie where that Cab driver locked the people in to kidnap them and when they tried to use the pull up lock, it turned out to be a sharp one that cut their fingers. But that incident with those Pax made me wonder if most Pax fear kidnapping or something else from the driver. I think a good chunk of Pax have a fear of the driver himself. If it is a woman driver I am sure their fear would be reduced substantially.

MInneapolis and a lot of Twin Cities in general needed a lot of road and freeway modernization as Cities like Luanda in Africa and China and some other developing countries have surpassed Twin Cities in road and free way/ Bridge quality. We had that i35W Freeway Bridge Collapse which they made a movie about. You don't hear major freeway bridge collapse in a lot of developing countries. I lived in Minneapolis a long time so I am happy to see all the new modernization of freeways and Minneapolis mouth.

I heard Pennsylvania is really messed up in road quality. I hope they start modernizing that bad boy. I noticed they started laying new Asphalt technology in some streets of Minnesota. Hopefully that beats the winter and lasts a long time. Potholes are freaking terrible so driving on bad road quality with bad old Asphalt takes a toll on our tires and wears them out faster, and am sure as an Uber driver you hate that because it means getting new tires or struts or brake pads. Oh speaking of pot hole damage, did you know you can submit a claim to the City or State to get reimbursed for damage you paid to get repaired on your car from a bad pot hole you hit or some bad bump from folded up old asphalt on the freeway? Your struts get damaged you can file, usually the State has a web page dedicated to submitting for re-imbursement of repair you did due to a Pot hole. City of Minneapolis also has that and am sure a lot if not all of US Cities have that.




Below is Luanda Angola. Ain't it crazy when developing African, Chinese etc etc countries like Luanda Angola are beating American cities in road and freeway/bridge quality?

I picked up a young man from his friend's place near Wrigley Field (by Addison and Clark) and drove him to the north side of the city in Lincoln Park. During the ride, he shared with me that he was recently graduated from law school. His story went on that he had a loving relationship with his psychiatrist while in law school and she was 62 years old. She was treating him at the time (I did not ask his diagnosis nor did he share it). They fell in love, and his parents sued her and reported her to the Indiana Medical Board. He told me that she lost her license to practice medicine as a result! Understandably, his parents were very upset because of the incredible age difference. 

So she is planning to move to Chicago and start a new life with him. He said he was 27 years old, and said she looks decades younger, and the love was real and deep, and she has a ""great figure"". He said he feels so much guilt at her losing her license, and will do everything he can to rebuild her life in Chicago. He told me that he works for the city as a Public Defender even told me his salary (which I did not ask). He said he makes $48,000/year. Finally, he informed me that he is determined to make it work.

Just before I reached her dropoff, she spilled the coffee on the floor when I braked (it was just a regular brake, not even slightly hard brake). I thought to myself that I'll just let it slide because I was headed home after this trip anyways, so I didn't plan to report this trip to uber to collect the cleaning fee. I would have just washed the floor mat myself later that day, I was still as nice to her as I was before the spill. One of the reasons I planned not to report it to Uber was that she was a minimum wage worker so I felt pity for her.

But as I am on my way home, I just looked at my driver profile and saw my rating changed from 4.96 to 4.95 (it was 4.96 just 1 hour ago), she gave me a 1 star. I know for a fact that it was her because I only picked up 3 other riders that day and the ride went smoothly. Now I don't know why she 1 starred me but I am guessing she didn't wanna be matched with me again to avoid the awkward situation. I don't know if its true or not but many riders have the PERCEPTION that 1 starring a driver guarantees that you won't be matched with them again.

A lady hood rat comes out with a paper plate piled with food and a spoon jammed in it. As she approaches the vehicle I ask her if she has something to put the plate of food into and she replies ""I won't spell it"".

I am assuming she's planning on holding it for the duration of the ride which was short. I put the car in gear and pull out and look back and she's already digging into it. I reach up and cancel the ride. I pull over and say I'm sorry but there's no eating. It's in the rideshare community guidelines. She gives me the usual flak and backtalk as she gets out.

I called Lyft to get unpaired from that rider and also to get a cancellation fee. I'm told by Lyft support that because I started the ride I can't get a cancellation fee.

The takeaway lesson? If you think that you forsee a situation with a rider that might lead to a cancellation, go ahead and cancel the ride right away before you start it. That's the only way to get the cancellation fee. Of course you'll probably end up canceling on people that you wouldn't need to, but that's on Lyft.",2020

I thought I smoothed things over and never said an unkind word. I even cited my girlfriend, an infectious disease physician, as a source.

And both of them passive aggressively emphasized they were going to tip me well in the app for being civil and informative. As we all know, this is how a certain breed of abusive passenger loves to inform you that you're about to be stiffed.

I keep my radio tuned to an 80's station and halfway thru the ride Aerosmith's 'Dude looks like a Lady' airs. At 1st I was mortified, picturing the rider flipping out, thinking i was discriminating against them etc. But they didnt react negatively at all. Of all times for that song to play... yeesh. 

I got one starred for refusing to take 5 people in my minivan. They ""accidentally called for an uberX. And when we saw you had a minivan we thought it'd be ok"". I explained it wasnt the vehicle capacity, rather Ubers Covid policy and insurance requirements(as if it mattered to them). so i took 3 and the other 2 called another uber. Within 30 minutes of dropping them off i had a 1 star. 

I had a girl throw a can at my van, or rather the passenger inside when he catcalled her. Put a nice dent in the side. 

I had a family of 6, a mom and 5 kids, the oldest of which was 11ish. And 2 cartfulls of groceries. They called for an uberXL but with the new regulations, we can only take 5. I genuinely felt bad for her so i cancelled the uber and drove her for free (well i got the cancellation fee which was ironically larger than the fare would have been). I explained ubers rider limit, and that i cancelled the uber ride but was going to drive her for free. This good deed earned me a good cussing out as they were slowly unloading their groceries. Also made me glad i turned my phone off in case she filed a complaint so my location isnt visible. 

I ran over one of those stupid scooters. The rider jumped off as it coasted right in front of me. Tore up my front bumper, and scuffed the side and rear of my van. The rider of course disappeared before i could get stopped. The following day I contacted the scooter company and told them what happened. I got a canned response and when I sent a more detailed email including pictures of the scooter and my van I got a response to their legal team that they are not liable for things that their Riders do and I need to contact my insurance company to see about getting my car fixed. When I asked for their Riders information so I could pursue legal actions against the writer I was told that they cannot give that out for privacy reasons and I need to contact my automobile insurance company to get my vehicle fixed. 

My last ride of the night was thankfully a short one that completed a consecutive trip quest. As we were driving i hear an ""awwww sh!t i put in the wrong house"" and he updates it to a place 40 minutes further away from my town. At least there was a healthy surge and the fare wound up being $30. While out there i was able to pick up as fare back to downtown. It would take me an extra 20 minutes to get home, but id earn another 20 to 30 bucks. 

This ride was at a very poorly marked venue (on a farm) the rider called to say that her phone was about to die and she would be waiting for me. Once I find the venue, I found her best friend but she was nowhere to be seen. After about eight minutes they found her waiting for me at the other entrance. She is drunk. Not blackout drunk or going to throw up in the back of my car drunk but drunk enough that her friends were worried about her safety in an uber. They are apparently all from small towns and were visiting and had heard all the typical uber horror stories. I insisted that we stopped by a service station so she can buy a phone charger so she could remain in contact with her friends if her phone was so low. She agreed this was a good idea and 5 minutes and $20 (of hers) we're back on the road. She was actually decent to talk to, and i enjoy chatting with riders. It was a 40 minute ride so we covered a lot of ground. Surprisingly we have a lot in common (shes just over half my age) so this ride was going great. Her friends checked on her a few times and she assured them she was fine and i was 'shockingly decent' whatever that means. And then we hit traffic. Thanks to a bad accident and road construction a 40 minute ride turned into an hour and 45 minutes. At this point im super thankful she agreed to get a charger. Her friends would have called in the cavalry. She asked if we could swing by chickfila for ""lemonade and nuggies"".

post-6639673,Young Kim,"Nov 19, 2020 at 8:30 PM","There must be something going on with me. I try to be a most patient and forgiving person. But just now, for the first time in my life, I really wanted to ""brake check"" somebody. (That is when you hit the brakes suddenly when someone is tailgating you.) I was driving with a passenger coming off the 90/94S at the 18th street exit in Chicago.

I never go above the speed limit but there was a guy who must have been in a hurry because he was tailgating me so close that I could see his face like he was sitting in my rear seats. Maybe a few inches away. Since I had a passenger, I dismissed of course actually hitting the brakes. But I thought to myself if I was alone, I really would have wanted to do it. He would certainly have hit my car because his was a larger SUV and since mine is a very lightweight Prius I could stop on a dime.

However, I think the headache would be more than it's worth. But it was just a feeling that I had.

Even if you knew you were not going to actually do it, have you ever really wanted to ""break check"" someone? (and if anyone ever has and they hit the rear bumper, what was that experience like?) Of course it would be their fault because they were falling too closely. But I'm wondering if it was worth the headache. Of course when he passed me he gave me the finger. That alone gave me some satisfaction actually. I knew that I didn't do anything wrong because he could have easily just passed me later. It was an off-ramp.",2020
post-6493390,Young Kim,"Sep 3, 2020 at 6:31 AM","Just dropped off lady pax to the south side of Chicago earlier this afternoon. Had a passionate talk about the city's rioting and looting. What struck me was her strong emotions on this... I picked her up from the Enterprise Rent a Car in Park Ridge, IL. When she got in, I saw that the ride was 35 minutes long, going to 24th and King Dr. in the city's south side (the ride took 43 minutes due to traffic).

I started the conversation off by asking her why she rented a car all the way out here in the suburbs instead of a place closer to the city. She told me that renting a car in the city is more expensive because of city taxes, the cars are kept up nicer in the suburbs, and there are few cars for rent in the city where she lives.

Then I asked her how she feels living in the city where so many buildings have wooden planks covering the windows after the destruction and looting. She replied with strong words that it was to be expected by white America, and that Blacks are not necessarily feeling that they are looting/destroying their own community (as the media likes to project), because she said none of it was ""theirs"" anyway.

So she just stopped of saying it should all be burned and looted, but she felt that it is . She is tired of people saying Blacks are irrational because they are destroying what is ""theirs"". She said they are just reacting to having no opportunities and the ransacking of downtown was meant as a statement because the Magnificent Mile is a symbol of the wealth inequality.

She repeated said that white America is being hypocritical by blaming Black Americans, because she stated that America was founded on violence anyway. She said that from the beginning, the whites burned and pillaged (just like what is happening in present cities) at the start of the country.

She brought up about the issue regarding the ""theft of property"" going on, that whites did the same and worse to the Native Americans. Regarding rioting and burning, she pointed out multiple instances where whites rioted and burned just like the Blacks are doing now when there was forced ""school integration"" in the 1950s. So she said violence is at the heart of America's DNA.

She concluded that white America should just keep quiet and try to figure out a solution to the ridiculous wealth disparity going on now. I usually never pick sides, but rather I am a careful listener, and try to understand where people are coming from. I did however, agree with her that in past history (World History), that whenever the wealth disparity got go lopsided, social revolutions followed.

She complained also that politicians are really dragging their feet about the new stimulus, and that made her very angry. Especially because most of the politicians are so wealthy. She said that people love to spend money, so why not stimulate? She said it would help everyone now, because people are suffering presently.

As I dropped her off, we did notice many buildings that were boarded up, and I quietly hoped that all this would stop in Chicago... She extremely friendly, and I wished her well, and that her car would be fixed soon....",2020

post-6599614,The Gift of Fish,"Oct 30, 2020 at 2:05 AM","I got a surge ping from a wooded valley. When I got to the house there was no cell signal and therefore no way of notifying the pax through the app that I had arrived. So I got out and rang the bell at the front gate of the property. No response. I honked the car horn a couple of times. Then I drove up a nearby hill a few hundred yards to see if gaining some elevation would yield me a signal. Nope.

I turned the car back around and drove back past the errant pax' house when he came out. He got in the car, admitting that he knew there was no signal at his house, yet tried to make excuses saying that the app said I was still some distance away.

I set off for his destination and drove about half a mile with him out of the valley and still the signal had not returned. I told him that I know from experience that with Uber, no signal means no pay for me. He told me that many other drivers start the trip from his house and get paid. But there was no way he could know if the drivers got paid or not.

He was already on thin ice for not being out and ready and messing me around at the pick up, so I kicked him out and told him to tell Uber to pay drivers when there is no cell signal if he wanted to complain. I would only have lost a few bucks for the part of the ride when there was no signal, but when Uber stung me last time over a similar situation and refused to pay, I did tell Rohit that if it happened again then I would eject the pax immediately.

Plus, I was in no mood for any bullshit from this pax.

Set DF for 100 miles past my house and headed out the door. Ended up getting 11 pings. 7 reasonably along my route, 4 were me back tracking more than 10 minutes to get a pick-up and maybe get a couple miles closer to my destination. I accepted them all and did the 7 that worked for me and ignored the 4 that Uber should have never sent me and let the PAX cancel. 2 of the 7 that I did carried a surge with them as well.

When I got home I ended up putting 356 miles in for the day, 63 miles more than driving straight home. Those 7 rides paid me $100.20 including $6.08 in tolls or $1.49 per extra mile driven. Plus almost half my normal tolls home were paid.

Good neighborhood so I just parked on the street for a while.

I see a car park and someone dashed out or the car and to the front door or this house pick up an Amazon box and run back. They stop 2 houses down and repeat. I put the car and gear and start following them, they stop in front of a house realize I’m behind them and dash off. I take note of their plate number and call 911. They pull over half a dozen houses down and I see someone run up to a door and come back with a brown paper bag and a drink holder:



I shit you not the porch pirate on top or Amazon orders stopped and picked up someone’s food delivery while they were at it right from in front of their door.



A few minutes later the cops come out and I give my statement. Tell him the plate # and he takes his report.


He goes up to the house and leaves notices that their stuff got jacked but the food delivery victim comes to the door. Next thing I know the cop points to me and the lady walks over.

I roll my window down and she thanks me for taking the time to report it. She goes on to tell me that she’s had Amazon deliveries go missing recently as well.


The cop comes back to ask for the camera footage and I tell him to contact the cab company and they would connect him to people with the power to pull the camera, and get him the correct contact people.


He thanks for the taking the time I head to the company radio shop as I’m not far away.

I tell them at the radio shop that the cops are going to ask for it if they haven’t already.


I’m already down the road done before I get told to bring the car in lol.




So the cops have enough to nail this porch pirate for 3 counts of theft (witness statement on one video evidence on #2 and #3.

The cop told me that with the dash camera video they should be able to get warrants to search their residences for more stolen stuff and it would Probably snowball with more charges.

post-6340269,FLKeys,"Jun 29, 2020 at 11:21 AM","Saturday night, Sunday morning, just before 1 am things are slowing down and lots of ants still out. I am parked outside one of the few spots left open to get a ride, about 25 miles from home, so I set DF to home and hope I get a ride at least part of the way toward home. About 10 minutes go by and I get a ping 2 minutes in the wrong direction however it is 18 minutes toward my destination. Great, I accept it.

Get there and there are two people outside a bar, 1 smoking and the other just milling around. About 2 minutes of waiting and the person smoking goes back in the bar. The other person continues milling around. About 30 seconds before the shuffle time pops up the person milling around walks up to my window and identifies himself as my PAX, I confirm his name and ask destination before unlocking the door to make sure it is the way I want to go. His destination is strange, a restaurant that closed over 2 hours ago, kind of a remote place for this area.

PAX gets in and we head toward destination. PAX is quite at first then starts asking strange questions and making strange comments. Nothing offensive just strange. I can hear him digging through his small backpack several times. I start getting that uneasy feeling.

He says in a mumbling voice that he is glad he will be starting a second job soon. I ask him where and he says I can't remember, it's South. I ask is it a hotel or restaurant and he says I guess I should have asked. At this point my creep alarm is on super high alert. I nonchalantly confirm my self protection tools are properly staged and I move my pepper spray to a quick grab position. Manually unlock my door, and make sure my seat belt release is not obstructed. I just had a bad feeling at this point.

My standard procedure is start trip and take a snap shot of the waybill. Second guessing I did that this time and my creep alarm going overboard I take another screen shot of the waybill just to make sure I have it. About a minute after doing this the PAX asks did you take a picture? I simply say I took a screen shot of my trip information for my records. At this point we are two minutes from destination. He replies I thought you took my picture. I said no need to do that the dash cam records everything and saves it to the cloud (okay the cloud part was a lie but he had no way of knowing that). I also point at that dash cam that is obviously right there. He implied he never saw it. 

We pull up to the restaurant and I ask him do you want dropped in front or on the side? He replies oh go past the restaurant and turn right on the first road, I live in the first building on the right. I do that and stop at the first building. He says no go to the end of the road and turn left and I am in the first building on the right. Okay there is no building on the right after you turn left, now my creep alarm is really going into overtime. I stop in the very back of the complex about 200 yards from the road and just stare at him through the mirror. He finally gets out and I immediately lock the doors and start driving off. I turn the corner and head out to the side road. I get to the stop sign at the main road and make a quick entry in my log book, maybe 30 seconds at the most. I look in my mirror and the PAX is walking toward my car. What the.....I hit the gas and turn on to the main road and get the heck out of there.

Now for this guy to get to the road that fast after I dropped him off he had to be running back to the road through the complex. I thought for sure this guy was going to try and rob me or something, I have never had such a bad feeling from a PAX in the 2+ years I have been doing this.

I was constantly evaluating my options once my creep alarm started going off and hoping I would pass a deputy sheriff on the side of the road like I usually do in this area and time of night, no luck. Because of the lack of cars on the road I figured my best option was to just be ready and finish the trip. While watching the dash cam footage this morning of the ride I got that same uneasy feeling. I think this guy was up to no good and started second guessing himself.

post-6635322,Monkeyman4394,"Nov 17, 2020 at 9:11 AM","My wife offered a co-worker a ride to work over the weekend. This person’s car is broken down. She was excited about her first Uber ride. She said scheduling the ride was super easy and took almost no time. 

Saturday morning, toes on the curb at 615 for a 630 ride. Driver pulls up. As she is moving toward the back door, the driver gets out, rushes around, opens front passenger door. She’s smacked in the face with the smell of weed. She looks in the back seat and sees it’s packed tight with garbage. Still, she gets in while this dude is holding the door open.

The ride should be mostly interstate. He, instead, opts to go the frontage route (which will likely take an extra 15-20 minutes). He’s sweating profusely and smells awful. He’s also staring at her a lot. She tells him there’s no way to get her to work on time off the interstate. He finally relents. 

On the interstate, he tells her she smells really good. She’s pressed against the passenger door to get a little distance from him. Pop! Blowout. He doesn’t call for roadside, doesn’t contact support. She finally cancels the ride and books another driver. She says nothing about it while he’s changing the tire. Car pulls up, he waves the new driver off (not knowing it’s another Uber). She books ass to the other car, jumps in, and they speed away. She clocked in two minutes early.",2020

She is way to nervous.

"" The Speed limit changed."" ""Well you keep looking back at me."" ""I am driving a car, part of driving is checking the mirrors, I check all 3 of my my mirrors every 45 seconds to a minute.""

In fact you see car carriers hauling cars that look like they would be headed to the crusher but they're not, they're headed to the local ""Auto Mall"" where people buy these smashed up poorly maintained vehicles.

In fact you see these total jalopy vehicles with paper temporary tags. Somebody just got their ""new"" car!

At a glance you can easily spot a handful of inspection violations. Things like no headlights or taillights, cracked windshield, missing mirrors, and belching smoke like a coal fired locomotive just to name a few.

One thing all these cars have in common is the paint's clear coat and some of the color coat below is weather etched away to some degree from all the horizontal surfaces. It makes me wonder if they don't bring these cars up from the south.

I kept thinking ""How do these cars make it through inspection?"". Even if you could get the inspector to look the other way about the missing/broken lights and mirrors, bald tires, bad brakes, etc, there's no way the vehicle would pass the part of the test where they connect the state's inspection computer to the car's OBD2 port and read the VIN and any check engine light error codes.

Then it hit me! [game show winning answer bell: ""ding ding ding ding""]. They buy cars so old that they have no OBD2 port. That way the inspection is merely a physical/visual inspection by the inspector and they put a smog sniffer in the tail pipe. The inspector certifies that he put the smog sniffer into the vehicle needing inspection but of course that's not what he does. He uses a different vehicle that can pass the smog test. Then gets a wad of cash from the ghetto car owner and slaps a valid inspection sticker on the windshield.

post-5864245,Darkseid777,"Feb 9, 2020 at 5:13 PM","The reason I finally quit after a year in working for all of these clowns (food delivery apps) was because of the fact that it was nothing more then a buildup to that fact finally occurring.

I finally had enough with being blamed for things that where out of my control whether having to deal with traffic, construction issues on the road, bad drivers, bad weather, and everything else in between.

I finally had enough of playing this where's waldo game with the customers who for some reason could never give me their right addresses let alone their correct telephone numbers or delivery instructions on where to drop the food and always expecting me to do door to door deliveries. I'm sorry but this is not get the door it's domino's they should come outside and meet you I'm a courier remember I'm not your babysitter that was expected to hold your hand.

Also forget about dealing with customer service between all these delivery apps because they were useless and beyond destruction and people wonder why their food was always late never mind the fact that once I got to the restaurant the food was never ready and that was with all of them not just Uber or Doordash.

A total lack of organization from top to bottom and who gets blamed for all this horse hockey the driver, what finally happened in making me quit was because I was on a double delivery for Doordash. The first order ended up being late to be dropped off because of the fact that I had to wait for the second order to be prepared and to make the drop off for that customer.

So to make a long story short I got into a shouting match with the customer who's order was late trying to explain to them what was going on and they didn't want to hear it so I lost it with them and cussed them out and slammed the telephone on their face and it was a long time coming.

After 500++ deliveries between all with these cats combined and this is how it ended and thank god I say and good riddance I should have quit a long time ago and as far as I'm concerned so should everyone else!!! I wasn't even making minimum wage for god sakes!!! if you factor in the gas that had to be pumped on a constant bases and maintenance of the car.

I had all my accounts deactivated and cut up all the debit cards and it felt great once it was finally done. There is a brighter future for me over the horizon and I will be moving on to the next adventure in my life and will be better off in doing so.

These app companies are nothing more then a detriment to society it has created a new legion of lazy bums who don't want to go out and even pickup their food anymore let alone eat at the restaurants either.

The drivers are now nothing more then truck drivers on a miniature scale spending all their time on the road living lives of solitude, stress, and pressure to make a few peanuts and are getting screwed by the customers in terms of not being tipped and having to deal with their attitudes of entitlement and bad behavior and also by the restaurants not caring when they hand the food off to the driver.

But least of all the restaurants are being screwed by these app companies with their god forsaken fees that they are being charged to use their services so everyone is being destroyed except for those at the top of these fly by night companies.

like I said before the sooner these app companies die and the sooner this entire gig economy dies the better we will all be for it. I've even heard as of recent that Uber and Doordash were trying to merge that's just what we need one great big incompetent corporation.

Oh and by the way I worked out of the Portland Oregon Metro market one of the worst places in terms of traffic and road conditions in the country especially due to the weather and all the construction constantly going on and having bad infrastructure over all.

That's with 1.3MM population, a very large DT core (see pic) and zero people out there walking along the streets............but still lots of ants, if the rider app is to be believed, which it is not 100%.

Trip count: over 14,000. In that time, I doubt I’ve given half a dozen one-star reviews. Customers have simply been awesome.
I’ve had but a handful of uncomfortable rides, mostly folks poor social skills whose nervousness killed the atmosphere.
Only twice have drinks thrown up- and they were kind enough to open the door and do it outside. Likewise, twice babies have spit up. No big deal- that’s what babies do! One person had their fast food order smear sauce on my door. One kid placed bubble gum outside the door. Maybe a dozen times folks have left minor amounts of trash behind.

I get a 13 minute / 7 mile ping. That's normally out of my range, but it was a slow AM, and there was a small $1.75 surge.

I get a message - ""There's 3 of us"" (I think I know where this is going, but I decide to play along...)

I breezily reply: ""That's fine, as long as you all ride in the back seat (I'm really REALLY loving not having to give up my front pax seat for any reason, ever...'m not sure how I'll readjust to the post-pandemic return to not being able to block front seat)

At this point the ride is off, but I'm toying with deciding who gets to cancel...then rider messages again:

""Y'all already stole one seat from us"" (I had no idea I'm an un-indicted co-conspirator in an act of Grand Theft!)

I'm done - immediate cancel- given the early hour and scarcity of ants, they'll likely learn a fair bit of patience or get some exercise as pedestrians.

""I can only take 3.."" 

They were super chill and got out. 

Canceled the trip and immediately called support. After fifteen minutes on the phone, the rep said that he had adjusted the trip and to expect a cancelation fee and that he had requested to not count against my CR. 

Waited a couple of hours, nothing. Called again. Apparently he was full of BS, straight up lied to me.

post-6590971,Kurt Halfyard,"Oct 25, 2020 at 9:53 PM","So I was 17 points from Platinum Status this morning, so I turned the UBER App on after noon, looking to get 6 short rides at 3 points a piece -- to lock in Platinum until the end of January 2021.

Got a couple short rides while I did my Sunday errands.

Eventually, I got a ride to Pearson Airport (TORONTO), and then another ride (not a rematch) downtown.

Lakeshore Boulevard was closed, and thus it was a special kind of  on Fleet Street.

While i was waiting for many light cycles to eventually turn left onto Ft. York, I heard on the radio that the COVID-19 cases in Ontario had crossed 1000/day for the first time. I thought perfect, I get one more ride on DF, and I hang up the keys until things settle for a while.

On the 6th ride, from Bathurst/FortYork to Church & Charles, PAX dropped their pin on the wrong condo, and I was about to shuffle, after texting the woman and her boyfriend, why I was on Bastion instead of at her Condo, they eventually walked to me. She gives me some flack about the address. I show where she dropped the pin, and that I am exactly where the pin is. I tell them I have no info beyond that

Thus, the ride begins on the wrong foot.

However, I recovered, when the dude really like the interior leather styling of the my car, so we talk about that for a bit. I tell them I'm impressed that after 5000 rides, and 3 years of driving, mainly the night shift, that the leather has held up so well. She asks me if anyone has every puked in the car. I tell her that I'm picky about the kind of drunk I may or may not pick up at 3am. She asks me what is the worst thing has happened. I tell her the story about the dude that got in covered in blood on Mercer St. after being in a full street fight. And how I didn't know at the time, as it was dark, lesson learned about the super late drunk shift. No bad pukers though.

We are driving up Spadina and turn onto Wellesley. 

To make matters worse, as I approach Church street, there is an Ambulance with full sirens and lights coming up behind me (about 6 cars back) as I am at the intersection.

There are cars parked on both sides of Wellesley so nowhere to pull over, and it is wall to wall cars behind me.

As the light turns yellow, I make my left turn onto Church Street in the north direction. Right into an oncoming Fire Engine coming south on Church. The fire truck was in the wrong lane to negotiate the intersection.

I did not hear the fire truck because of the Ambulance.

We miss collision by about 10 cm (That's about 4 inches).

Passengers in the back are freaking out with a window full of fire truck! I manage to pull onto the east side of Church to take a breather.

I told the lady-pax. Congrats. In all of my 3 years of Gig-Driving, that was the most dangerous thing that ever happened. You get to be part of the story. She was not impressed.

Either way: 

And it was also the universe giving me an unambiguous sign to take a good long break from Ridehail/Gig Driving (as per my 1000/day resolution to stop driving).

I hopped on the highway, after that and drove home.

But. Platinum. Though. For what it is worth(less).

I even told her that it's no wonder she has a 5.00 rating and that it's nearly guaranteed that tipping a driver in cash will always get you a 5*. 

The other two were anomalies however. One of them took about 4 minutes to show up and snuck a 4th pax in the back without me seeing. Boom, 2*. The other was sloppy drunk, took it upon himself to switch up the radio and crank it to full volume without asking and was yelling out the window at some people as we passed by another bar just down the street. He also decided mid trip to switch the location considerably further away. I was intentionally rejecting longer rides at that time since it was last call and super busy.

The first driver farted around for 5 mins, then called her and asked her to cancel the ride, claimed his car wouldn't start. She had to get to work, so she did it. Free $$ for the driver, lol.

The second driver was taking her to work and he gets a phone call. He answers it and rambles on in some other language for about 5 minutes, then his phone died. Uh oh... he plugs it in, and tries to turn it on every 20 seconds. Meanwhile he is still driving, but he is going 15 in a 40.

My friend is concerned about getting hit from behind, but whatever. It's his car.

My friend says she could tell him where to turn. It's the same route she takes 5 days a week, so she knows the way pretty well, as well as the alternatives. He ignores her and continues to proceed at 15 mph.

The phone finally gets enough juice to turn on. Eventually the Uber app comes up and the guy freaks because he is about to miss a left turn. Without warning he jolts left and almost gets them T-boned.

My friend is having a mental heart attack and says ""That car just missed us by a foot!"" The guys says ""We're fine."" and keeps driving.

post-6343855,LyftUberFuwabolewa,"Jun 30, 2020 at 8:46 PM","... because all I have is hindsight.

As we all know because of the COVID-19 virus we are not supposed to touch a passenger's belongings.

Well I accept an Uber ride and arrive at the pick up and it's a woman in a wheelchair and there's nobody there to help her. This means I'd have to handle her wheelchair.

Before any of you light your hair on fire, I've carried an untold number of people with wheelchairs, walkers, etc. I have no problem with that and I do it all the time.

However now that were under this whole thing with COVID-19 if I handle the persons belongings I'm putting myself and the company at risk to be sued. Congress still has not yet passed any limits on COVID-19 liability.

So I asked the woman if there's anyone who can help her with the wheelchair. She says no. I informed her that we're not supposed to handle a persons belongings. I was about to cancel the ride but I really didn't want to leave the woman stranded. Not because I was worried that I would get reported for refusing to carry somebody with a wheelchair since I would only be following the companies rules about not touching a person's belongings. I didn't want to leave her out of sympathy. I'm realizing now that I'm probably going to get one starred for doing my good deed.

So I asked her if she's OK with me touching her wheelchair and she said that was fine. She gets in the car, I put the wheelchair in and off we go.

Then three times during the ride she mentions that she's going to call up Uber and ask him about this thing about a driver not being able to touch her riders belongings.

It was at this point that I realized that she was a lot more pissed off than she was appearing, and she was also failing to see that I had done a good deed by bending the rules in order to accommodate her. She clearly was not appreciative.

When the ride was over I called Uber to ask what I should do in a situation like that where there's a rider who needs physical assistance yet at the same time we're under a company wide rule of not touching a passenger's belongings.

All I ever got back from the company was an email with the standard boilerplate stating how we are always supposed to make every attempt to assist a writer with a disability. I guess they're more afraid of those kinds of lawsuits then a COVID-19 lawsuit.

Oh and by the way I did get the one star and a service complaint from that limp legger as well.

So this only makes me more dedicated to following my own role that you either: A. Cancel a ride before starting it or B. Drive the ride with a smile without any complaining. Complaining and then driving the ride or driving the ride while complaining only guarantees you problems.",2020

Need two more rides to finish up for the night and I’m in the downtown area. Get a ping for a pick up at a club.

So I pull up as close as I can get and no pax to be seen. Time is ticking down, eventually the back door opens, I turn around in time to see two guys with ‘security’ written on their backs dump this drunk chick in my back seat and close the door, without saying a word to me.

Her last conscious act was calling her girlfriends who were still in the club, I heard the call go to voicemail as she flopped over passed out.

Great. (nice ‘girlfriends’ I thought to ditch their friend in this condition)

So on we go, luckily she only lives about 8 minutes away because I was worried she’d throw up in her sleep.

We get to destination, she lives in a row house on a narrow street and I can’t get her to wake up to get her out of the car, so I park on the sidewalk/yard so I don’t block traffic. 

I open the back door, yelling to try to get her awake, literally have to sit her up in the seat, she comes to enough, I tell her to put her feet out the door, she says ‘yes sir’ and puts one foot out and slumps over passed out again. I get her to come to again, this time both feet out the door and she manages to stand up, every time I ask her to stand up, it’s ‘yes sir’ she must’ve thought I was a cop.

I hand her her purse and phone and she’s looking in my car asking ‘where’s baby?’

‘Who’s baby’ I ask?!

‘Luna my dog she was in there.‘

Great, now I’m wondering if it’s just booze she’s had tonight. Hallucinating her dog was in the car and I’m trying to reason with someone out of their mind that her dog isn’t in the car.

I finally convince her the dog is in her house, she mumbles something about ‘Luna’ breaking her leg as I help her up the steps. 

I wait on the top step making sure she makes it inside and swipe this damn ride as OVER.

Ok, this is wrong on a lot of levels. We’ve all heard the horror stories of what happens to women with unscrupulous RS drivers. But regardless this girl should not be alone in this condition. Two security guys knowingly dump her into a car without even checking out the driver? 

Also, it was obvious she’s going home to a dark house, no one there, she could throw up and choke to death, or unwanted boyfriend could show up, any number of things. Too vulnerable in her condition. Someone should’ve gone home with her. Club security should’ve seen to that.",2020

Pick-up is the end of a cul-de-sac. After waiting a minute, I text, ""I've arrived"" and the address. 2 minutes later (3 on the timer) I get the ""I'm holding up my phone"" message. WTF??? I look around, no one. The street is a block long, so I drive the block, and come back. Nope! Nobody!

One more minute ( 4 and a half on the timer) and the front door opens. Pax gets to the car and tries to open the door. ""You need to have a mask"" I tell him.

""It's in my pocket"". He tries the door again.

"" You need your mask on!""

""It's in my pocket!"" He tries door.

""I reach for the phone, and say, "" Put your mask on!""

He pulls out his mask and puts it on. I unlock the door, ""You didn't have to yell"". 

"" sir, I asked you 3 times for your mask. That was your last chance before I left.""

On route, ""Can you stop at 7-11?""

""Only if you add the stop on the app""

""Why not?"" 

""Because I don't get paid for stopping unless it's on the app""

He adds the stop. Goes in and buys a pack of cigarettes.

""Do you want a $100 tip?""

Sure

""Answer a question. Are you voting for Trump?""

""I don't want your money!""

Next 3 miles, he is badgering me, Answer the Question! Why won't you tell me! Are you ashamed?

I get to drop off, and he keeps talking. I finally reach for my phone and tell him I'm calling the police if he doesn't get out right now. He keeps talking until I hit the button, then he leaves.

What made this ride stick out was that he told me that he was a graffiti artist who tagged a bunch of businesses and public areas in downtown Chicago. I drove him up to Libertyville, IL, so it was a very long ride. He showed me a bunch of pictures and gave me his Instagram page where he puts up his work. He said that every single one of his friends are not white. Dad works for FedEx as a delivery driver and tells him whenever he sees his son's work as he drives around Chicago delivering packages for FedEx. Funny thing is that he told me his dad was actually proud to see his graffiti all over Chicago.

Even though he lives and works so far in the suburbs, he told me his one mission right now is to save enough money to move back to the city. There, he says he can hang with ""his homies"". He says he can't get along with other whites, and would rather date non-whites. I asked him if I could put up some of his images on UP.net and he was so happy to give me permission. He said he found it absolutely thrilling to ""tag"" especially downtown landmarks. Unfortunately, he told me that some of his crew were snagged by the Chicago Police for tagging ""The Bean"" (a large art statue in Millennium Park). He was very atypical, very anti-establishment, into theories of MK ULTRA and believing that the government is a truly evil entity bent on subordinating the ""innocent lost sheep"" as he liked to call the people.

I was about to pull off when an Asian woman came around the corner and flagged me down. Fine, drove up to her. She was on the phone and clearly didn't speak English, the pax name was male.

She kept pointing, then signaling to stop, then pointing further away, etc etc (while on the phone and walking) for a good while. I asked where we were going, no reply. One last point, ""Rider did not show up"" - and finally some English - ""Here!"". Sorry, time way up - about five past the cancel limit.

24 minute ping to an Italian restaurant (that's basically every trip here now) at around 2pm. Again, on the pin, texted ""I have arrived"".

Dude passed out on a bench, assuming he was my pax. Premium pickup plus a small surge.

$10.93



Immediately after the drunk, Walmart 4 minutes away. Same drill, parked between both doors with my hazards on, scanning for my pax.

Just before the timer ran out, ""I don't see you"". Told them where I was (had DF set). Scanned for anyone who appeared to be looking for me, gave them another 4 minutes, gone.

Out of necessity, I began delivering food yesterday. Made $70 in three and a half hours, today around $100 in around five.

Saw some things that made me chuckle.

People wearing masks alone in their car or riding bikes / jogging with nobody around. There's no evidence that this is airborne, folks. Person to person. But pollen is pretty nasty right now.

People wearing masks with their nose not covered. Know where they insert the swab to test for COVID-19? (Well, technically, nasopharynx). Wear it properly or don't wear it.

Advance Auto, associates think that it's a better idea to handle items brought to the counter and then taking your credit card or cash, pushed back and forth on a cart. Not washing their hands. They've managed to actually INCREASE contact.

And their delivery guy, buddies, other associates? Oh, they know them, so no need to do anything differently. Because it's just ""stranger danger"", right?

Grocery store. I was standing on the ""six foot"" mark, moved maybe three inches from it and the associate told me to step back. Then, came around the Plexiglas divider they've put up (again, still handling items, and it's pretty pointless), about 14 inches from me, to say ""thanks for not buying more [TP] than you need"".

The interesting thing is, about 6 weeks ago, I had my best week - when Uber and Lyft (especially Lyft) were offering very good promotions....but the last 4 weeks have been bad - I guess since the unemployment ended, there are many more ants so there's no need to offer meaningful promotions. And maybe that's the problem - I got a taste of a pretty good hourly rate for a few weeks, now my rate is down about 20%. It's hard to take a pay cut.

I've been part time for about 20 months - 4,300 rides total. I did stop for about 10 weeks when Covid started..I know much of the below is obvious, but I thought I would list what I've seen lately. Maybe this is just the normal progression of anyone that does this for a while - at least I made it this long. From my understanding, about 95% quit within a year.

Again, this just may be the normal progression of someone that has done this for a while. I know 20 months is not long for most jobs, but it's probably equivalent to 20 years in a non Uber job. I have the utmost respect for those that do this full time. I don't think I could....",2020
post-6528408,Kurt Halfyard,"Sep 22, 2020 at 10:23 AM","I should have known better. That is the primary lesson here.
It was slow last night and I (FOOLISHLY) accepted a 4.66 STAR passenger, lets call her ""N"" who happened to be nearby at 10:40pm, and was (via Uber Pro's time and direction info) doing a halfway decent length trip on UBER.
I arrive in the condo-townhouse complex.
Three people smoking on the stoop.
N walks towards me with a pizza box (Pizzaiolo, Small) in her hand.
I roll down the window as she approaches and ask, ""Do you have a face covering?""
She holds up a mask in her hand.
I say, ""Can you please put it on?""
She says, ""Yes"" while trying the handle.
I roll down the passenger rear window, ""I'm going to need that on before you get in the car.""
She angrily THROWS the pizza box in my car (nearly hitting me in the head).

Enough of this. I haven't started the ride yet. Count down timer is still going. Time to SHUFFLE for No-Mask.

She starts screaming behind me.

I leave the complex and notice that she has also flung her phone into my seat.

I am driving along Thomas St. in Mississauga and am about to pull over when a JEEP pulls up behind me at high speed, then make a sharp swerve in front of me at the Thomas Glen-Erin Light. There is no traffic at that hour. 
Her two smoking buddies (dudes) get out of the jeep and cross their arms. She comes running out, ""You STOLE my phone *******."" 
I reach in the back seat, grab her phone, and hand it to her, silently. I'm not going to escalate this any further. She gives me the finger, and screams again as she gets back into the Jeep. Her pals do a 'donut' around my car in the middle of the intersection. Another driver who has stopped at the red light on the other side of the intersection looks on with curiosity.

I drive off to another block, park on a side street and end the ride, selecting ""NO MASK""
I discard the pizza box left on my seat from the throwing incident. (It is garbage day tomorrow in this neighborhood, so I just leave it with one of the houses curbside pile of trash, which had a few Pizza Nova boxes off to the side).

I file a report with Uber's App ""Trip Issues"" but have to attach it to another previous in the day cancelled ride (as the last ride doesn't show up in my history, because the ride was not started beyond the 'count down clock screen'.)

I get another ride request while I'm doing that. Just before I drop off the passenger, I get a phone call from the UBER Safety Team. But I let it go to voice mail, as I'm still completing this current ride.

I call them back, and talk to the person, explaining the above to UBER Safety -- passenger N with the 4.66 STAR rating was out of line with throwing objects into my vehicle, and then chasing me down at speed on a residential roadway. They say they will look into it.

My account goes ""OFFLINE"" minutes later. with the BLUE STRIPE in the driver app, ""YOUR ACCOUNT HAS AN ISSUE""

Ancient Corporate Proverb: No good deed shall go unpunished

Currently the account is temporarily on hold, but when I try to log in, it says,

Lots of winery traffic, tons of visitors, weddings, and a gorgeous fall day was the perfect combination. My final ride of the evening was a Waffle House scheduled pickup at about 11:30 pm. I thought (of course) that ""nothing good is waiting at Waffle House after 10:00 pm"" but decided to check it out, it was on my route home and a 15 minute trip. Four (very!) nice young women were waiting, probably grad students. All holding coffee cups, all clearly intoxicated. Due to the way the parking lot wraps around, I was on them before I could cancel, and they immediately approached the car. I rolled down my window and said ""Uber X is maximum three passengers due to Covid guidelines."" (I no longer take four under any circumstances.) The response was, verbatim; ""Don't give us that bulls.h.i.t.! (Instant cancel decision made.) We have been taking Ubers all day and not a single driver said a word. Besides, it's FOUR, not three."" My response; ""Sorry girls. This is clearly shown on the Uber app, it is definitely THREE."" At this point I still can't roll away due to cars in front, I want to get around to the other side and wait the 5 minutes. Their leader's response; ""First of all, we're not girls. We're women, and we're graduate business students. Don't EVER call us girls, you creepy old f.a.r.t.! Second, you HAVE to take us, this is a scheduled trip."" At this point, I'm getting all sorts of flashbacks to being a cop but I bite my tongue; entitled graduate business school students can be extremely annoying. My retort: ""There is nothing inappropriate about calling you girls. And in fact, you are now acting more like 19-year-old sorority girls than graduate students. I take what I do seriously. I do not take four passengers for Uber POLICY reasons; for safety and insurance requirements. Please request another Uber. Oh, and I'm also a biz school alum; class of 2002. Ask your class mates if they have met me; look me up in the alumni directory. I DO NOT appreciate being verbally abused."" Boom. At this point THEY cancel and I get the fee. Not a murmur as I roll away. 
Once before I encountered a group of MBA students who asked a couple questions about my profile and actually laughed when I said I was an alum; ""Yeah, right!"" sort of reaction, followed by ""Name two of your professors."" As if most of my professors are still there, nearly 20 years later. So I pulled over, asked for their school email (which one guy gave me) and sent him an email with my alumni email address.

What the hell, it was a short distance to pick up the parts, which turned out to be two small boxes from a freight liner parts place, and the trucker was a six mile trip from there. Two miles past an exit on 95 south as described by ‘pax’ She entered a nearby address for the app.

So I find the truck and pull off on 95, hand off the parts to the trucker, apparently he’s been broken down awhile. Dude is without food and asks if I’ll run him to the next exit for food and back. The ride is still active so I call and explain this to Monica and she ups the tip another 10 to get the man some food. Fine with me, found a Wendy’s and backtracked down 95 to the truck.

Alls well that ends well, 66 bucks for the adventure and helping out a trucker down on his luck.",2020

I get a ping from a restaurant I’ve had decent luck with that doesn’t have a drive through.
.
I get a ping taking food to a hotel, a hotel with kinda pissy staff. This comes from years of dealing with them.


I get the bag of food to the lobby and get a text to bring it up to their room on the 12th floor...


&)&$”$)&@&!


It’s 2 huge bags of probably an $80-$100 order from a mid range restaurant.

Miller’s ale house.


And I call le paxhole.


“We’re not coming down for it you need to bring it up”


I show the valet the response...


“No... for one you can’t leave your car parked for the 15-20 minutes to get up there and back and we just arnt going to let an unregistered person go through the hotel. They are going to have to come get it.
Just leave it with me.

“The valet isn’t going to let me in the hotel. Your going to have to come to the lobby sorry”


“This is unacceptable we arnt paying for it and I’m going to tell them you never arrived and we arn’t paying for it”

Whoah whoah WHOAH.... hold it a second....

I tell the valet that there’s drama and show him the text chain.


I called grub hub support and... they sent that text chain through the app....

I know this is going to be a problem...

I talked to The support guy about the issue, and he says the customer was hell bent on denying I arrived with the food while I’m still at the lobby laughing my ass off... trying to get them agree to come down... Rather than get Some bs drama from them over not getting their order after leaving it with the front desk and having them NEVER come down to get it. I wanted them to just tell me that they are going to get it from the lobby. That’s all I was asking for.


After like 5 minutes of waiting I get a call back from support.

“Destroy the food. They don’t trust you didn’t tamper with it... your good”

“I haven’t seen anyone come down to the lobby and there’s restaurant seals on the bags”


“Your good, enjoy destroying it sir”


I look at the valet...


“You eat lunch yet bro? You earned it”


Yep I give this giant prick who has been a pain in my furry behind for years an entire entree. I also give out drinks to the rest of the hotel lobby staff a couple of drinks each (6 cups of flat Diet Coke? I’m not losing much there)


I guess this is a free food jackpot?",2020

post-6481482,MondayMan,"Aug 28, 2020 at 10:09 AM","Names have been changed in this story so I don’t disappear.

I’ll start with some background information. When I first moved to New Jersey, it wasn’t long before a guy who called himself Paul from Brooklyn stopped me in the parking lot of my workplace to welcome me to the area and to tell me who I should meet. He told me several names of people who owned businesses in the area. He said, “When the lights go out, these are the guys with the generators.” (Later I googled some of the names and found several old New York Times articles about their suspected involvement in mob hits, bribing judges, etc.) Then finally he told me the name of an Italian restaurant where the higher-ups meet for dinner every Thursday night. Which takes us to last night, a Thursday.

I don’t usually drive in the evening, but Uber suckered me into it with a quest. If I gave four more rides for the week I’d get a $35 bonus, and that seemed (meh) ok, so out I went after my kids’ bedtime.

After three rides, my fourth and final ping of the night came from “Frankie” at the Italian restaurant that Paul from Brooklyn told me about. I pulled up and saw two men and a woman at the corner. I stopped right behind a Rolls Royce, unlocked my doors, and confirmed the name. One of the men tried to get in the front seat, but I asked him to ride in the back because of the covid regulations. They weren’t excited about cramming three-wide into the back seat of my compact car, but they said they were only going three blocks so they’d do it.

Me (joking): “Is that your Rolls Royce?”

Frankie: “Yeah, I just had a few too many so I’m gonna leave it here for the night.”

Other guy: “Wanna race?”

Me: “Ha ha. Do you guys live around here?”

Frankie: “Don’t ask questions, just drive.”

Me: “Ha ha, ok.”

Me: “How is that restaurant? Sorry, I know that’s another question.”

Frankie: silence

Me, dropping them off: “Ok, nice meeting you guys. Sorry again for the close quarters in the back seat. Have a good night.”

No tip. But I got my $35 quest bonus and went home, and I don’t think I was followed.

post-6532904,The Gift of Fish,"Sep 24, 2020 at 6:46 PM","In California Uber currently tells drivers at ping time the estimated value of each fare. Early this morning I received a 3.1x surge ping that Uber valued at $1,193 - $1,457, with a pickup in Redwood City CA and destination Los Angeles, 350 miles away.




I accepted the ping, assuming that that pax was a numpty who had entered an incorrect destination. I planned to arrive at the pickup and have the pax enter the correct destination, preserving the 3.1x surge for the ride. I set off for the pickup, which was 10 minutes away.

Around 5 minutes after I accepted the ping, I got a message from the account holder. She said that I would be picking up John and taking him to LA. I texted back, asking her if she was aware that the fare would be around $1,400 and that it was a 3.1x surge. She replied that when she booked the ride yesterday, her Uber app had given her an estimate of between $350 - $500. I told her again that if her friend took the ride, the fare would be around $1,400. She replied that the friend must get to LA, that I should pick him up and do the ride, and that if Uber charged her that amount then she would fight it with Uber.

So, sports fans, there was a decision to make. The three options were:

a) Shuffle the pax. Because of the distance I drove to the pickup, the no show fee would have been around 9 bucks.

Advantage: It would be 9 bucks.

Disadvantage: It would be 9 bucks.

b) Do the ride. For any noob drivers playing along at home, this ride request raised red flags. The first was that the account holder would not be travelling, therefore there would be no gps record of any pax travelling with me. Second, it would have been an extremely high value fare and subject to Uber's ""review process"". I would not be paid the fare unless and until Uber approved payment to me. Third, the account holder had already confirmed that if she got billed $1,400, which she indeed would be, she would fight the fare with Uber.

Advantage: If paid out by Uber, this would be an enormous fare. I had just bought 10 no-commission pings for $7 from Uber, so I would keep the entire amount paid by the pax, less $3 for the ride fee.

Disadvantage: Uber has a track record of refusing to pay large fares. I would inevitably have to fight Uber to get paid. I would be risking driving 700 miles / 11 hours round trip for no pay and could also be out of pocket $60 for gas.

c) Offer the pax a cash up-front deal.

Advantage: Uber would be cut out of the deal, therefore no risk of being screwed over by Uber and not getting paid.

Disadvantage: The amount that the pax would likely agree to would be less than $1,400.

I can tell you that I did not choose option b. With those three red flags, setting off down the highway and hoping for the best would be, like watching granny porn, something that you just don't do.

So folks, what would you have done?",2020

1) A grocery pick-up in a Chinese supermarket. It looks like knowing the Chinese language is a prerequisite for delivery drivers now.

2) We all know Walmart pick-up is never worth the effort. Groceries pick up is not the case. There was a $4 bonus per delivery and the first customer left me a $4 tip. Walmart staff brings the items to your car but you need to bring every bag to the customer's door. If your customer lives in an apartment complex then you are @@ed (which I was @@ed by the 2nd delivery + no tip).

3) As the message indicates, the customer planned the delivery too early for her friend. Normally I would not have waited particularly with the famous line ""I will tip you later"". She then called me saying that her friend was walking back home from the hospital. Something inside me told me to wait. This RN did keep her promise and gave me $5 cash.",2020
post-6565515,MadTownUberD,"Oct 12, 2020 at 7:36 AM","About half an hour ago I pulled into a McDonald's across from the east Towne mall in Madison, an area with a sharp increase in panhandling recently. I stopped in to use the bathroom, then planned to get breakfast at the drive thru vs. at the counter due to spiking COVID cases.

As I exited the building, a middle aged man was screaming obscenities at a car that was pulling around to the drive thru. He asked me if I worked there, perhaps because my outfit today looks somewhat like that of a McDonald's employee in the dark, to which I answered ""no dude"". He mocked me, then continued his cell phone conversation.

I went through the drive thru and got my breakfast. The car he had screamed at was right in front of me. Dashcam ready, I was preparing myself mentally to witness a fight. After I got my food, I pulled into a parking spot, windows cracked, to eat my food and wait for a ping. The guy was still there so I locked my doors.

He started to explain himself. I asked why he had screamed at the car, and he said the driver had swerved deliberately to hit a cat. He said he was a father of four, a school teacher, and a cat lover. ""Not everyone is a panhandler, not everyone is a criminal"", he went on. He mentioned something about staying in Sun Prairie and that he'd give me $12 for gas money because he can't afford a taxi. Apparently he was asking for a ride, which I verbally questioned and he confirmed. Something about needing a jump and calling the police....I didn't quite follow. ""Imagine yourself in my situation"", he said.

I briefly considered this proposition, at least transporting him for free (for insurance reasons), then realized everything that could go wrong...most notably contracting the 'Rona. I simply have too much to lose, even if his motives were pure. There was too much that didn't add up. If he's a school teacher, why does he need help? Why was he near east Towne, several miles from Sun Prairie? Why would he offer me $12? If he had a phone, why didn't he request an Uber?

He seemed mentally unstable and his story didn't make sense. I told him ""I can't do it"" and he said ""thanks anyway"" as I pulled out of the parking lot. This sounded eerily like the ""God bless you anyway"" that some panhandlers say to me when I refuse them. Yes, I am a heartless monster.

So my question to you is: is this a new type of scam? I've been hearing the one about ""needing gas money to see my family in Milwaukee/Chicago"" for years, but a scheme in which the person offers ME money?!?!",2020
post-6569394,FLKeys,"Oct 14, 2020 at 1:34 PM","Yesterday evening I get a ping at a local resort, pull up and see six people standing in a group. One walks up to may car and says they ordered 2 cars can I wait a minute for the other driver to show up se they can see who will fit where. I say sure are you Jeff? He says no I am Gary, Jeff is right here. I'm like okay this car is for Jeff so Jeff will need to at least be one of the people that ride in my car. They ask why and I explain that in the past I have had negative experiences when there are multiple drivers and the person ordering the ride does not ride with me. 

The other driver shows up and Jeff and Gary both get in my car with someone else and the other driver gets the 3 other people. We are going to a restaurant about 5 miles away. The other driver rips out around me and pulls out on to the highway. I follow, much slower. We have to head South and make a U-Turn to go North.

I see the other drivers blinker come on and say hope he is not turning there, there is a no U-turn sign and a state trooper sitting right there. Sure enough he make a U-Turn and before he is even all the way around the trooper turns on his lights and goes after him. They ask me to pull over so I do. I say this is exactly why I want the person ordering the ride to be in my car, if you were in that car you would most likely down rate the ride even though I did not make the illegal U-Turn. After sitting a few minutes and a phone call to the other car they had me continue to the restaurant. 

I drop them off and head back to my staging area and get a ping from Gary. Pick-up is, you guessed it, side of the road where the other driver was pulled over. Get there and the other 3 are standing behind the state trooper car waiting for me. I pick them up and take them to the restaurant.

Haven't picked up anyone at the airport in at over six months, learned my lesson not to bother with the queue long before the pandemic. 

There are multiple zones for commercial pickups, two for RS that are seperate by a good distance. This other Uber driver was to my left, cones were blocking me from getting to the RS #2 location. 

He stops next to me (I can't go forward), honks his horn, and says ""that's not the Uber spot"".

Three business guys in their 30s, as the other driver pulls off one of them says ""jesus, what an ant! Look at his tags!""

60c per 80 seconds and I’ll gladly wait while they are doing all their grocery shopping.

post-6543477,FLKeys,"Sep 30, 2020 at 10:35 AM","First off surges in my area are extremely rare. Since the sticky surge started I have never received a surge ride that started in a surge zone. All rides started well after the surge is off the map and I only get the sticky amount. Side note this past New Years Eve resulted in no Surge rides do to driver saturation.

Last night after I drop a PAX off I find myself sitting in a Surge zone with $1.50 sticky. I don't typically drive around looking for work so I park and sit right in the middle of the zone. After about 10 minutes it jumps up to a $6.25 surge. Within a minute I get a ping, a comfort ride. I accept, it is very close by less that 1/2 a mile, still in the surge area on the map. Thinking to myself cool this is the first ping I ever got that is in a surge zone since they started the sticky surge.

I get there and at that point I notice it is a scheduled trip and I'm thinking damn I'm not going to get the surge.

Do the trip, and I immediately look to see what the PAX paid and what I got paid for the surge.

PAX paid regular price plus they had a $10.00 off promotion. They ended up paying $16.40. If I try to book the same trip right now with no surge it is within $1 of what they paid before the coupon. So they did not pay any surge.

I got paid $31.66 for the trip including a $5 tip. Uber lost $16.26 on this trip. My Surge portion was $15.38 clearly more than the $6.25 surge I had on the app.

So I got paid more than the sticky amount on a scheduled ride. I was surprised to see this after reading so many threads saying riders paid surge and drivers did not get any extra. Also the rider did not pay any surge so really confused that I got paid above the $6.25 surge.

Also within a few seconds of me accepted the ping the surge map that I had up on my tablet immediately went away. I keep my tablet open with Uber on it to use as a reference. I can see surge while on a trip, I can see if a PAX left a tip before I rate, etc.",2020

post-6528735,NotYetADriver,"Sep 22, 2020 at 2:08 PM","Last night I needed a 10 mile ride in Fort Lauderdale.

After putting in the information, the quote came back at $29.75.
I was ready to confirm the ride but my Visa card had expired and so I had to re enter my new CC and information.

This time the Fare came back as $66.00. (For a 10 mile ride) 
Underneath the quote it said (fares may vary significantly during peak or busy times) even though a moment earlier it did not.
The area was a ghost town. Only a few cars here and there.
Obviously I declined.
Uber probably desperately needed the money, but I'm not willing to be their sucker. They lost the entire fare.

Frustrated with the absurdity of Uber, I called YellowCab

It was a much quicker online experience and easier process on my phone and the quote for the same ride was $31.75 which I accepted.
In 10 minutes the Prius arrived and the driver was very nice.
I wasn't even asked about payment and no card or cash was necessary to get into the cab.
Super cool guy.

I got home, payed the driver and tipped him $10.00

Based on this, I will probably call YellowCab first from now on.
Anyone who accepts a 10 mile ride for nearly $70 is crazy. And any company who would try that is a failure, if not a thief IMO.
It was not a ""peak"" time and I'm sure many drivers could have used that fare....but Uber's greed cost everyone involved with Uber.
I wonder how many times per day this happens?

Uber has lost their way and I can't see their business model lasting much longer. They lost California and will likely lose NY soon.
Especially when taking a Yellow Cab is less expensive and just as good if not better service.
If you are an Uber driver I'd start looking for alternative income sources.

The only caveat could be if this was a freak incident. But I doubt it.",2020

post-6523241,Slackrabbit,"Sep 19, 2020 at 8:42 AM","FML. I was at a complete stop at a redlight on my way to pick up a ride. I was rear ended by an SUV that was rear ended by another SUV, which in turn, pushed me into another car. I was in a rental thru uber, which is likely a total loss, as was the SUV that hit me. The at fault party was in a newer higher end SUV. The airbags deployed, and her radiator was punctured, along with severe body damage, so it may be a total loss also. The car that i hit didnt sustain much damage, because i always leave 4 or 5 feet between my car and the next at stoplights.

post-6503058,Young Kim,"Sep 8, 2020 at 3:56 PM","It takes a whole lot to get me annoyed, but I did (a little bit) after a conversation. Pickup up pax in Chicago wealthy North Shore and drove him downtown. He looked like he was in his late twenties. We started by talking about young people having a hard time finding work in general. Then he suddenly started up with blaming everything on Trump. I agreed with him Trump has character flaws. He kept going off about how Trump is ruining the country and turning us into a third world nation. I often have my guard up completely and walk/talk softly when it comes to politics with pax. So I tried to be as gentle as possible.

I did agree with him that our country has problems, but we are a great and wonderful nation. He answered back something like, ""No, we are a stupid country with stupid people who elected Trump as our president"", and then said something that somehow irritated me. He said something like, """". And then, """".

I very carefully pointed out that the U.S. still has the highest immigration by far, so there must be at least some people who like to come here. And I did point out to him in a respectful way that if he is going to move into another country he has to have money/and or skills. I did ask him what he did for work, and he said he was out of work now, but his last job was retail in Old Orchard Shopping Center. And he did say he lives with his parents and has little money.

He said that under Trump the U.S. has lost its status in the world, and started demeaning so many things. I nicely and kindly pointed out that the U.S. is still leading the world in many areas like high technology (Silicon Valley), educational institutions like the Ivy League, great movies, sports, and the military. He countered a story that I am not right about the military, like the Air Force. He said when he went to Israel, he talked to the Israeli Air Force and said their Air Force was vastly superior to that of the U.S.

So, I looked at him in the rear view mirror, and asked, ""If there was an plane battle with ALL planes, would you take the U.S. Air Force or the Israeli Air Force? (I just wanted to see what he would say...I know such a thing would never happen between two friendly nations)"" And then he replied that, ""No doubt the Israeli Air Force"". I pointed out to him that the U.S. Air Force is probably ten times larger (I didn't know off the top of my head). He responded back, ""But the Israeli Air Force pilots are much better trained."" To which I replied, ""Maybe, I have no idea, but the U.S. Air Force is not some third world country trained group, and the U.S. probably has hundreds of thousand of planes vs. tens of thousands of planes for Israel"".

At this point, I was more curious that someone could be illogical. So I pressed a tiny bit more... I asked him, ""Then do you think that in the middle of the Pacific, if there was an air battle, then say 30,000 Israeli pilots could take down say 300,000 U.S. Air Force pilots?"" (I know that such a battle would NEVER occur because the U.S. and Israel are close friends, but I asked just for a case example). I waited for it... and he answered, ""No doubt, I'd bet on quality over quantity any day"". So concluded with saying on the subject, ""Sir, you may be right that quality is better... all things being equal, but quantity DOES matter. In an air battle over the ocean, there are not many places to hide except the clouds"". (I told him that I have no doubt that Israel has an incredibly trained Air Force).

The subject came back again to Trump, and I wanted to make sure at this point that I didn't upset up, because I really don't like to argue with pax. When he said that under Obama the economy surged and under Trump the GDP was negative, and now plunged... I very nicely pointed out the facts. I told him that GDP growth was actually positive in every year Trump was in office, and the negative GDP numbers was due to Covid. I just gently told him that he has valid criticisms about Trump and told him he should tell all his friends to vote, As we came towards his destination, I steered the conversation into a friendly one about the Chicago Bulls.

I don't know about you guys, but whenever pax say something TOTALLY illogical, I like to carefully steer their logic in the right direction WITHOUT upsetting them. I think this is hard to do, and maybe it is a lot easier to keep quiet and just nod silently. But sometimes driving for a while can get boring. And when a pax says something so obviously wrong, I'll point to their mistakes. In this case, I got slightly annoyed and had to check myself when the pax trashed the U.S. the country and its citizens. I wondered if he hates it so much, he should leave. A lot of people would like to come here, in spite of all America's flaws...",2020
post-6517039,UberFizzle,"Sep 16, 2020 at 5:07 AM","I responded to a request that was a few minutes out of my way, but I didn't mind [much]. It was a gated community, but the pin drop was just outside the gates, so I waited there. I messaged that I was there (just in case the pin drop was a mistake), and the passenger responds, asking if I can wait there. He doesn't say when he'll be out. Weird, but whatever, I'll wait for 5 minutes.

5 minutes go by, no one in sight, so I no-show the guy. Sure enough, as soon as I turn around to leave, some dude sprints out of the security office and comes running toward my car as I drive away. I was parked right in front of the office the entire time, within direct view, which tells me he knew I was there, and just didn't bother to come out. I think he just assumed I would wait for as long as he took. What a mistake on his part.

As I drove away, he's screaming for me to stop, and my passenger side window was slightly rolled down enough to where I could loudly say ""Nope"", and drove off. Even as I continued to drive away, he was literally screaming for me to stop, and even asks if I'm an Uber, but at this point, he's to my back, and I'm almost at the stop light to turn. In situations like this, I don't slow my exit because people can be very crazy, especially when upset. He yelled some profanities, I took that right turn at the light, and drove off. I usually have very little sympathy for people who show such blatant lack of respect for others' time.

Seconds later, as I'm driving away, I get a ping from the same guy. I decline, and continue on my way. It's not like I'm the only Uber around, so he can just wait for another driver, and hopefully show a little more respect for that driver's time. Interesting thing was his rating was a 4.98.

I have been doing IT since 2017 and I mainly drive weekends. At my IT job I work with a handful of people that I support with tech and app issues. There were 3 people that I believe I had a Glitch in The Matrix (What are the odds of that moment). All 3 of these people I managed at one point help with a tech issue or setup a new work laptop for.

The first I also happen to somehow get paired with in Uber, her friends and herself were downtown when I got the ping and she was surprised she got me as her driver. She is one I also usually help stuff with periodically at the IT job and she is my co-worker there. 

2nd person I picked up her friends and herself too at a southern city that is 30+ minutes away from where we work. I am rarely at this city as it is farther away from where I live in. She was also my co-worker and I assisted her numerous times.

Third person is a man and I picked him up from his house and took him to airport. He is also my co-worker who I interacted with at IT job numerous times.


It doesn't end there.


In Uber I picked up exactly the same group of people. A husband and his wife, and a short guy who makes funny jokes who I clearly 100% remember driving the previous year and here is the shocker, both the precious and current year I took them to same concert at Surly and they happened to request when I was the only driver near them, Uber only pairs by closest driver to you. I happened to be in Golden Valley again and near them when they requested so it is as if they had some higher self psychic ability to know I was nearby and they requested me at just the right time.


Then there is a Doctor who told me she is Jewish and she is rich too, she owns a Multi-Million dollar house. And every-time I am passing by i394 and right before I miss her exit, she just happens to ping me as if some higher self in her has psychic ability and knows exactly when to request to get me when her subconscious knows I am nearby and gives her idea to ping me. She got mw 4 different times. 

And we are talking about a city of 5 Million people here with at least 10,000+ Uber drivers and even more Lyft drivers.

It doesn't end there. There was 1 day where I had Mike, Michael passengers back to back for about 4 hours, what are the odds of seeing Mike or Michael back to back non-stop.

Then there was a day where I drove a Vikings Football player from airport and as a gift he gave me nice expensive headphones then that same evening I also happen to drive another important person. A Professional Hockey player for VanCouver who I drove to Hotel so he can stay there for his upcoming game next day and he was a rich guy too. I am like how do I a regular Uber manage to drive Rich sports people?

Then there are about 3 teens in a nearby city who are college kids and they somehow request exactly perfect timing to get me on random times and days, so what are the odds of that? I drove them about 5 times on various random hours and days when I arrived near wherever new location they were.

post-6514157,Young Kim,"Sep 14, 2020 at 6:19 PM","Had a pax who was 24 years old. Picked him up from downtown and brought him to Western Springs, IL. I often ask what is a person's most defining moment in their lives (once I developed a warm, kind, friendly, and gentle rapport). Unfortunately, it was not a happy one. He told me the both his parents died last year suddenly from a car accident. He told me that happened on the expressway, and someone had rear ended them and the car crashed into the median. He had one brother, who lives out of town. He said that while of course he was devastated, he was still in a sort of denial. Interestingly, he said that he can't get himself to tell anyone because he said he said that he doesn't want pity. But...telling me (a person with no connection at present or in the future) feels OK to him. 

When people ask him, he still cannot get himself to tell them that both his parents are gone. He said he hasn't even sold their cars yet. He had previously lived with his parents. When we got to his home, it was a nice house, and I saw two newer model cars in the driveway (one was a BMW). He seemed OK and had a good head on his shoulders. He now lives completely alone... I wished him well, and hoped all will work out for him. I reflected on this, and thought how quickly a person's life can change in an instant. Losing both parents in such a sudden unexpected way is just so unthinkable especially at age 24. BTW, he said that his occupation was an electrician...",2020

post-6500420,The Gift of Fish,"Sep 7, 2020 at 12:22 AM","Inspired by a recent post by , I thought we should share the shuffle, or shuffles, that were the most satisfying that we have had. Mine is:

A French man requests from a restaurant in downtown SF. Immediately outside the restaurant is a bus stop, so I pull up to wait on the other side of the road about 4 cars away. Pierre emerges from the restaurant with two children of about 3 and 5 years of age and, of course, stops on the curb at the bus stop. Pierre starts to look at his phone, then he looks in the direction I am sitting, then in the opposite direction, and then back to his phone again. I decide to phone him.

- ""Alo?""
- ""Hello. I cannot pick you up from where you are standing because it is a bus stop""
- ""Why can't you pick me up from a bus stop?""
- ""Because I am not driving a bus""
- ""What makes you think this is a bus stop?""
- ""The words Bus Stop painted on the road 6 feet away from you""
- ""This is not a bus stop""
- ""Please turn to your right and walk 30 feet. I will pick you up there""
- ""I have children. I cannot go""
- ""I see that your children are equipped with legs""
- ""What?""
- ""Your children have legs. They can walk 30 feet""
- ""No. Cancel the ride""
- ""No""

This back-and-forth continued as the timer counted closer to 5:00. Pierre ended the call as he flagged down a taxi. He grinned stupidly at me as he passed me in his cab, apparently quite pleased with himself that he had managed to hail one. I grinned back at him as I pressed the button to take the $5.00 fee from his account. It was not the most highly paid shuffle I've had, but it was the most satisfying.",2020

1) I need to find a dark place to park STAT!
2) I'm married
3) Should I leave the meter running? (obviously a yes). I mean, how often do you get paid for this.

post-6506836,Young Kim,"Sep 10, 2020 at 2:21 PM","I was driving with a pax going north on Ridge Rd in Evanston, IL. It was dark at nighttime. I was driving a few miles under the speed limit (my guess is I was going around 30 miles her hour). Suddenly, I saw a family of raccoons dart out between parked cars from my right side. I first saw them in just a flash, but then it seemed to happened in slow motion, as I slammed on the brakes hard. My passenger was quite startled. His body hit the back of the seat. I thought I heard a noise... I stopped. We told ourselves that I probably avoid them, and they were ok. So I proceeded to go to his destination (I did not get out of the car after I braked). The ride lasted a few more minutes. He told me that he saw the family of raccoons as well dart out between the cars, and there was nothing at all I could have done differently. I apologized to him because of the sudden stop. He responded that had I NOT stopped so suddenly, then he would have thought there was something wrong with me, so that made me feel better. (Physically, he was just fine).

I was really bothered by this, so after I dropped him off, I retraced my path. After several minutes, I believed I was at the right place. I didn't see anything at first, but after exploring the area, I did see a raccoon lying on its side. Likely it was the same raccoon, but I wanted to believe it was not the raccoon that darted in front of me. All these years I have been driving for Uber, I never hit an animal. Come to think of it, I don't think I have ever hit even a squirrel in my entire life. This was the first animal I ever hit. (I am STILL hoping that the animal I saw was indeed NOT one of the raccoons in the family that darted in front of me). Anyhow, I was really bummed out, and felt pretty bad. As I reflect on this, I really don't think I could have possibly seen them in time, as they literally just ""jumped"" in front of my car (and they were hidden in between the parked cars on my right side).

post-6502976,Young Kim,"Sep 8, 2020 at 3:00 PM","Dropped off pax on Labor Day (yesterday). 3 minutes into the ride, he asked me to pull over. The door opened and he got out. And then the vomiting started... I've had many pax vomit before, but this one was particularly vulgar. Five minutes of heavy vomiting on the street and sidewalk. It was sort of funny when a couple of other cars saw him when cars stopped at a traffic light, and they were yelling out to him sort of laughing. He kept on apologizing to me over and over, and I told him it was fine and ""we've all been there, don't worry"".

He was hunched over for a while looking dizzy, and I was afraid this may turn into an ""Uber Ambulance"" ride... I knew he lost a lot of fluid, because his was a ""projectile vomiting"" followed by ""dry heaving"" (when it gets so awful that in the last few nothing comes out). I tried not to look but when I checked on him, it was a sight to see. It was all over the street and sidewalk and there was  hanging out of his mouth. From experience, I have a ""vomit kit"". That is: 1) paper towels, 2) vomit bag (if he gets sick again), 3) breath mints, 4) water bottles, and 5) a vitamin tablet and aspirin. I threw a jug of a gallon water container onto the vomit to disperse it, and then I gave out all the items and he was extremely grateful... (he was white as a sheet) but we continued the 12 minute ride that ended at Jefferson Park train station. (Naturally the paper towels stayed out of my car)

I made certain that there was no vomit on the back of his clothes before he came back in my car, but I knew some had to be on the front of his clothes... because he smelled wretched (smelled of death, really it was THAT bad). After the doors closed, all the windows came down. I tried not to gag myself. His was a type of vomit that had a terrible acid like scent (very common I guess). So I breathed through my mouth. After he left, I did inspect his seat and there was no visible vomit, but the terrible scent lingered. I have always 3 full cans of air freshener, so I made sure I spray bombed his seat and the back completely. Today, it doesn't seem to smell, and I found he tipped me $4 and change on the app.",2020

I was trying to stay close to home while finishing up a huge, 70-trip weekend bonus quest late tonight. I'm live 30 minutes from the actual surge areas in my market (Pittsburgh), so most drivers aren't hanging out this area (neither do I under normal circumstances, too). But it was 9pm on a Sunday night and I needed 5 more trips to nail that big bonus.

It's so secluded and desolate in this county, all the Mom n' Pop shops close up at 6pm here. Leaving the big chains to cover the food orders 'til 10 or 11pm.

So ya, it's 9pm and ping: $22.01 w/ included tip. 14 minute trip. Banged it out, and as I slid the delivery button, next ping: $22.01.

And the next: $18. And the next: $22. And the next, $16.

So when I say I ""played cleanup"", all these places I showed up to had these orders waiting for a very long time (2 hours on one of them) for a driver. No drivers = no deliveries.

The orders sat for so long, they capped out the $15.00 delivery payment from Uber, and the rest was tips, etc.

I'm considering doing this regularly from now on. Sit at home on Sunday evenings and go online at 9pm to close out the ballgame for 5-6 orders ~$22 each.",2020

Ignoring the 'punching down' racism and framing of this former query (it's edited above, and I'm not linking to the closed thread. But I'll bite.

Why Do I Drive when I do NOT NEED the Money?

For one, I have a hyper efficient vehicle (EV), so maintenence and fuel costs are minimal, even as mileage is racked up on my vehicle (which doubles as our family car).
For another, I have a mild case of insomnia (A 'Night Owl' by nature) and used to channel the late hours watching, reading, and writing. There is precious little income in it, particularly FILM-writing, but it allowed me to travel the festival circuit for a while as an accredited film critic. After nearly 20 years of obsessive movie watching and 10 years of freelancing, podcasting, and generally other contributions 'for the love of cinema' I figured I would get my eyes off the screen, and onto humanity. Yea, in part, I'm in it for the masochism () I'm not a tourist though, I have logged a serious number of rides on both platforms, have participated on the LYFT Driver Advisory Council (LDAC) and tangled with the late-night bar crowd often, and occationally the commuter rush.

There is no greater 'STEW' of humanity than RideHail Pax, outside of public transit Pax (and I wasn't becoming a bus driver, the dayjob has to pay the bills!) I only do people though, not interested in shucking around food or Amazon packages

Flexibility of the Gig-Apps, and low barrier to entry allows for more 'utilization of a depreciating asset,' and the tax write-offs (when stacked against my Professional Day Job) are pretty good. Ride hail + Dayjob brings my income into 6 figures, whereas DayJob alone is close but no cigar. So yea, the pennies help.

For all it's bullshit, and mind-games, and entitled pax, I still kinda like doing it. The power to 'turn it off forever' on a whim is seductive

The area where the customer works is not where you will find decent orders or rides but it is just a few miles away from Cheesecake Factory. What's better than getting paid to drive for lunch? Shocked by seeing 10 cheeseburgers, I contacted support to verify the order. To my surprise, they found me an agent almost in no time. After putting me on hold for ~2 mins, he confirmed that the order was accurate. Such level of competence is likely non-existent in Uber. For entertainment purposes, look at the estimate (bottom left, small font). Where can you buy 10 burgers for $8.29 in 2020 &#128558;?




After placing 2 large bags in my car, I went online on both apps setting Cheesecake Factory as the destination in hopes for fishing a ride or two. At a paltry rate of 50 cents / mile, long-hauling only makes sense when doing rideshare at the same time. My experience with the combination of Postmate and Lyft is quite positive for the 2 times that I have tried. Unfortunately, this does not apply to Uber. The pick-up location shown by the first ride request is in the correct general direction but requires back-tracking west. Needless to say, no way would I accept a 4.46. My jaw dropped when receiving the second ping. Are you kidding me Uber?? How can this ride bring me closer to Cheesecake Factory while I was only ~3 miles away??




After unloading, the customer gave me $2 cash. She wondered why it took so long before somebody accepted the delivery. All I replied was a smile. She works in an area where people are cheap as dirt (Westchase in Houston, TX). More importantly, it was a 15-mile delivery which is guaranteed to be a money losing drive.

On Friday evening, a man from an upscale neighbourhood has made a $150 order from a sushi bar. After he thanked me, he asked if I wanted a bottle of wine from his surplus. Since alcohol is never my cup of tea, I respectfully decline and was told to wait. A few minutes later, he returned with a pack of frozen sirloin stripes and giant scallops. He explained that his fridge was almost to the full capacity because of the obsession of his wife to fill the trunk every time they shop. Does he always trip drivers like that? Actually I have to thank him for the awesome sirloin! Not much effort is needed because the stripes were already half-cooked. What you need is to pan-fry them to your preference. Amazing enough, a manager from a seafood kitchen where I have picked up food from multiple times gave me 2 crabcakes. Contrary to what you may expect, there were only tiny shreds of crab meat. Anyway not in the position to complain because they don't cost me a dime. What do they taste like? Honestly they do not taste any different from croquettes.

Found a relatively smoke-free hideout within the state. Bivouacked at a cheap motel. Ubering and Lyfting daily to pay travel expenses. The area has a reasonable amount of rideshare demand and is slightly underserved, enabling a reasonable gross of $1700 last week.

Was driving the day U/L threatened to shut down rideshare rather than obey the judge's order to convert drivers to employees. What a mess, and what terrible timing. I'm sure this has been discussed ad infinitum, but the drama of that day is likely the best PR move U/L could have made to promote California's proposition 22, which is slated for a November vote. Many passengers had been informed ride sharing was shutting down at midnight and were not happy. As with smartphones and Air B&B's, many can't live without Uber.

I am reluctantly suggesting to my pax to vote YES on prop 22. Damn it.

Because of the number of trips I'm taking the Uber pax stories are piling up. Learning to 1-star pax who cheat with their masks by slipping them down during the trip when they think I'm not looking. Love it that Lyft will not make a match in the future if you issue the pax 3 stars or less. Not sure about Uber.

So here is a postcard&#8230; One memorable trip was with Eva. She did not even get in the car, but I remember the ride. Upon arriving at the pickup she ran up to the car from a lively courtyard, a large and apologetic smile on her face. She was a goddess. Light in complexion and light on her feet. The kind of woman a man would lasso the moon for.

Turns out she had called a car for her two drunk male party guests. Figures. But Eva had played it respectfully by first coming out to the car and asking permission for her two inebriated friends to be driven home. She spent a minute or two breaking down the situation, insisting that her men were not so far gone as to get sick on the trip. That assertion, plus Eva's sincere effort to make everyone happy, was enough to gain my acquiescence. And although I was memorized by her magical gaze, I maintained enough presence of mind to reserve the right to refuse service once the two tipsy curmudgeons came in to view.

Eva, smiling and gushing thank you's, turned and ran to fetch the soon to be passengers. At about 10 feet from the car I spoke the words ""Eva the Diva"" in a normal tone of voice. She heard the utterance, stopped momentarily, did a 180 twirl, smiled and curtseyed before continuing.  couldn't help but smile.

The ogars appeared, struggled with their masks for a moment, and poured themselves into the car. Once seatbelts had been fastened we were off. It turned out that the men had standing in the community. Both Eva and one of the men had quietly tipped me off that I was driving the D.A for the city of _____ home. Not the assistant D.A.,  D.A. The gentleman tipping me off to that fact had an interest in a couple of the most renowned restaurants in the locale I am servicing. None the less they both behaved like beligerant high school kids on the drive. Ha ha. At one point restaurant man offered me as much as $100 to allow him to remove his mask. I repeatedly declined, and both men let out an astonished gasp when they realized I could not be bought.

The two men were being dropped at differing destinations. They argued about who was going to give the driver a cash tip. In the end neither did. Eva had warned me in her backgrounder that ""They're a**holes"". Before ending the trip I broke character and texted Eva that her guests had been delivered safe and sound, and neither of them had tipped. When I later checked the ride history a $10 tip had been added.

Eva is a classy gal. I hope to run into her again.

Hmm. I suppose  is a poor choice of words in our profession. Lol.",2020

post-6487735,FLKeys,"Aug 31, 2020 at 10:50 AM","Early Saturday morning, while still at home, I get a 104 mile ride. Friday night was slow so I take the long ride. I don't mind long rides, the only thing I was concerned with was hoping I had enough gas without having to stop as I did not fill-up Friday night because it was so slow and I was already home waiting on rides.

We had a great conversation talking about fishing, both salt water and fresh water. Made the trip go real fast talking about a subject we both enjoy. The rider was meeting a boat owner at a Marina and was working as a mate, they were leaving on a 8 night trip from Boca Raton, FL to Key West, FL, to the Dry Tortugas, and finally to Naples, FL. They will leave the boat in Naples for routine maintenance and some time in mid October will make the same trip in reverse.

We were about 3 miles from the destination and my car was sitting at empty with an estimated 4 miles until empty on the display. Way to close for my comfort. The rider says hey do you mind if we stop at a convenience store so I can grab a couple items. I say no problem I'll just fill my tank while you run in. As I pull up to the gas pump the rider slides over from the passenger side to the driver side, he gets out and puts his credit card in the pump and says fill it up. I tell him thanks and he runs in the store. I finished filling up before he gets back in the car with 3 bags of drinks and snacks.

We get to the Marina and the rider drops me a $50 bill and thanks me for taking the long trip and making the stop at the store for him. $36.64 to fill my tank and $50 on top of it made for a very nice tip.",2020

I canceled the ride and pull to the curb. I open the automatic door and tell her that I can’t take her because she won’t keep her mask on.

She says she’s willing to put it back on but I’m done talking. Sure, I could say “I just asked you to have your mask on before I even arrived” but why bother.

The road opens up to two lanes going our direction and now he decided he’s going to do that NASCAR move of zigzagging back-and-forth cutting me off so I can’t pass.

Eventually we come to an intersection with a light and he had to stop. He picks the right lane so I pull up next to him. His window is down so I put my passenger window down so we can chat. I point to each of my cameras and say “you this, this is a camera” “you see this, this is a camera” “you see this, this is a camera”.

Yes I have muchos cameras.

I told him I was going to send the video to his boss. The guy acted really aloof trying to show that he didn’t care. He pointed to his belly, I’m not sure what that means, then he held up some drinks he had in a drink carrier from a takeout place, showing them to me. Again not quite sure what that meant.

So when I was done driving I uploaded the video to YouTube publicly. I mentioned the name of the hotel which is clearly visible in the video. 

I narrated the video with text, pointing out that you can clearly see I had the green light (and their driver ran the red light), and pointed out his road rage activity.

Protip: if you’re going to road rage, don’t do it in a company van with the name of the company and the phone number plastered all over the vehicle.

Once I had the video uploaded I contacted the hotel company, AND the parent company on Facebook and Twitter. I mentioned the driver's behavior and noted that he seemed ""intoxicated"".

post-6483619,Cvillegordo,"Aug 29, 2020 at 10:17 AM","Yesterday I decided to try Uber Eats for the first time. The experience was mixed; a few deliveries were smooth and paid well, but others were not smooth and paid peanuts for the time spent. While returning from a nice $25 ride to the Trump winery 25 minutes south of Charlottesville, I accepted a ping for a delivery from a Smoothie King along my route. When I arrived, the first annoyance was having to park about 50 yards away from the restaurant. Then, stand and wait to speak to someone. FInally they hand me the order; a large smoothie, in a cup, dripping purple smoothie goo, no napkins, no straw, no cup holder, no bag. I asked for all those things and went out to the car, managed to strap it in so that it wouldn't spill. Got a phone call from the customer. He is a conductor on Amtrak, the train is in the station, and I will need to park and walk over to the last car in the train to give it to him, as he is still checking passengers on board. (AYFKM?) I explain that I cannot park, he will have to walk over to the parking lot, he says that is not possible. So we have a bit of a dilemma. I have no choice but to proceed; and when I arrive, sure enough, I see a sizable crowd with no open spaces anywhere near the train. (Our train station is pretty small, but the parking lot is a pain.) I call him again, and then make three circuits of the parking lot waiting for him to come out. He finally walks over, super nice guy, apologetic, thanks me repeatedly. No tip.

post-6476325,MyJessicaLS430,"Aug 26, 2020 at 12:51 AM","This evening I delivered 5 pizzas to a mansion in the Memorial Villages, which is an upscale residential district in Houston, TX. My customer Steve called me saying that his place is difficult to find in dark. While I used to have a number of decent rides from the Memorial Villages, this is my first time to be in the area after sunset. He told me to specifically look for the mailbox 11XXX and take the driveway beside it. Can you picture yourself illuminating almost every mailbox on a poorly-lit road with a phone?

Somehow I managed to find the said mailbox. Locating his mansion has then become a lot easier (the only mansion with lights on) and he was waiting outside. As I was unloading, he asked 'can you drive me to Trader Joe to grab some beer?' He offered me $50 upfront. What a surprise. The trip, including waiting time, took about 40 minutes (one way 4 miles). On the way back, he added a brief stop at an ATM and gave me another $20. After he thanked me for the ride, here came the classic line 'I will take care of you in the app'. As of this moment, the promised tip for pizza delivery has not shown up yet.

My wallet was then inflated by his $10s and $20s. What has actually caught my attention is a $10 banknote with a completely different design. Mr. Hamilton depicted in the older version also looks older than his 'recent portrait'. The older banknote (upper) was printed in 1988!

post-6460840,MyJessicaLS430,"Aug 19, 2020 at 9:51 PM","Perhaps the behaviours below are a part of TX culture. I can't help but to curse those who use the road improperly.


A considerable number of drivers do not accelerate to match highway speeds which defeats the purpose of entrance ramps. Cars therefore pile up, hence increases both the difficulty and risk for drivers behind to merge. Moreover, this is also the cause of congestion of feeder roads.


Why don't plan ahead? Whose fault it is to miss an exit? Texans, please be considerate. Use the next available exit if you miss yours. Some even have the nerve to cross multiple lanes to exit from the far left without signalling. Such selfish and reckless act can lead to a chain of accidents. Is sparing a few minutes of time really worth the consequence to bear legal and financial responsibilities for collisions and subsequent injuries, if not death?


Most highways covering the rural areas have signs that read 'no trucks on left' or 'left lane only for passing'. I always wanted to drive a tank to crush those older Prius / Corolla, U-haul vans and even 18 wheelers occupying the far left lane. Most of the time, these vehicles travel below the speed limit which is extremely annoying. A lot of sections of I-45 toward Dallas have been under construction for donkey's years, leaving only 2 lanes available. How do you feel if you were behind a vehicle on the left lane that is travelling at 60 mph in parallel with the adjacent vehicle while the limit is 75 mph?


It is already ridiculous enough on the right lane. This dangerous behaviour imposes more threat to the left lane traffic. Drivers behind may misjudge the speed and fail to slow down accordingly. What's worse, the driver behind may attempt to swerve to a pre-occupied adjacent lane. Not sure whose fault it is. The person driving below the speed limit or the driver who swerve as an evasive manoeuvre? If those people are not confident to drive the speed limit, take a bus or request a Uber. From my point of view, driving too slow is far worse than 'reasonable speeding'.


Thankfully Houston is not a city for walking or cycling but I do have a few encounters. To name a few, joggers crossing a road under orange pedestrian lights; students in a group marching at their own pace; housewives crossing multiple lanes from one side to another with kids; cyclists without a green arrow light expect oncoming traffic to yield, etc. They certainly have the freedom to die but definitely not the right to get innocent drivers involved!

For me, I vote #2 for the most despicable road usage. Please feel free to name any behaviours that your despise of. Enjoy your evening.",2020

Its horrible especially in light of warrants not being used either anymore and all of the so called secret courts and such.

I told her ""easy listening"" 93.9 (what you would hear at the dentist's office). She said she loved it and asked me to turn up the volume, which I did. Then she told me she was drunk, and asked if she could drink out of her bottle... (I did inform her of the laws). Then the desultory and strange conversation started... First, she kept on asking me if I was a cop... I told her ""no"", and that it would be silly for an undercover police officer to pose as an Uber driver. She then asked me if I am going to take her to prison, upon which I again said no. (She asked this multiple times as well).

She asked all about my musical tastes, and I told her all genres, and she kept talking about her favorite music groups. Then, she started asking me about my religion when she saw my cross, and tried to make a connection. She went through how she was kicked out of Catholic school and is now a Lutheran. M told me repeatedly during the ride that she was currently running away from her husband, that he was crazy, and she needed to get away. She didn't have a job... She kept on telling me that I should never get married, and that marriage is a disaster. She then asked me my age, and I told her ""28"", and she said, ""Too bad, I am 50"". (The passenger I would say did not seem at all drunk, and I did not see or smell any bottle of liquor). 

Then she told me her pivotal moment in her life (positive) was when she found the Holy Spirit and Jesus. M then told me her lowest point... when she was 8 months pregnant with her son (who is now 22), she was intoxicated with alcohol and got into a car crash on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago... and was arrested. She had to be induced for labor and then DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) took away her son for a while. Then she told me her life story which was full of tragedy.

Then she said a few things which were so strange and somewhat funny... (During the ride, I patiently listened and tried to be a good listener). She cried momentarily because she said I was so understanding, and she that we had a deep connection. When I told her that I had an older sister by 2 years, she replied, ""Whoa! That is crazy! How did THAT happen?"". (I thought to myself silently, ""Well because my parents had intercourse two years before me""). And at the end of the ride she said she would not leave my car and kept talking, asking me if she could request me again. I had another ride stacked after, so I politely told her I must leave. M then said, ""Then please tell me a parting Bible verse that you like, which could help me"". I thought for just a moment after her difficult life, and I replied, ""Hebrew 12-10: ""They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness."" Her face lit up and she said the verse really helped her, she left the car, saying that she and I will meet again...and that she would request me again.

post-6449329,ariel5466,"Aug 14, 2020 at 11:35 PM","Tonight was my first time driving since March 15. My anxiety about money started to outweigh my anxiety about driving in a pandemic, and Uber finally decided to toss some great promos my way, like an extra $3 per ride.

So great, in fact, that I made twice as much in promos and surge than fares. &#128514;




I wanted to go until midnight but it turns out I desperately need a new phone. My phone lost its fast-charging capability and I kept going until I got under 15%. If I can manage to get 50 rides this weekend I'll get an extra $95, but it'll be more challenging with my current phone situation.

Pretty much everyone wore masks without being asked. I only had to ask 3 people to put their mask on and they did without a fuss... even though it was pouring rain all night and I wouldn't let them in until everyone was masked. But everyone said they understood and it was no problem.

Overall I'm happy with how I did. But if it wasn't for those promos and surge, it definitely would not have been worth it.",2020

I figure before I contact support I’ll go online with the other platform and get a few rides.

I can’t go online with that one either! What the hell?

I called the first company.

They tell me they can see that my account is on hold but they don’t exactly see why. There’s been no complaints or accusations. My rating is fine. I haven’t had any tickets, accidents or run-ins with the law. The company said it’s not a problem with Checkr. All my vehicle's documents and inspection is up to date and they can see that.

After a lot of time on hold they tell me they’re going to have to pass it to somebody higher up to look into it and get back to me.

I called the other company and basically have the same conversation. They see no reason why my account should be deactivated.

Then about an hour later I get an email from both companies.

It seems that they’ve deactivated my accounts, both companies on both platforms, for being an obnoxious buffoon on UberPeople.net

post-6448829,The Gift of Fish,"Aug 14, 2020 at 8:00 PM","Uber's offer to us in response to AB5 was:

- No more up front pricing
- Return to 75/25 or 80/20 split
- Return to multiplier surge
- Set your own surge
- Destination and trip length visible on ping screen (although declining ""too many"" pings now results in drivers being deprioritised and receiving few pings for the rest of the week)

For me all this wasn't enough. In order for me to vote for Prop 22, I would also want:

- Pay rate minimum of $1.10 per mile + 40c per minute. Set your own surge but with a minimum of 1.0x to prevent morons from ruining prices with offers to take pax at 0.5x. Suggested surge indications on the map to show where high demand is.

- Cap on the number of drivers at, say, December 2018 numbers. Active driver numbers can only go up in proportion to number of rides given year-on-year. For example, if Uber's ride figures for June 2020 are 10% higher than they were in June 2019, then Uber's total active driver count can only be increased by 10% over what it was in June 2019. This would allow the service to grow while not increasing driver saturation.

And that's all I'd want. Nothing too outrageous that would kill the goose. There's no point in saying $10.00 per mile, a new BMW and a daily foot massage.

He again asked me to wait, and said, ""Please don't cancel, I'll make sure to pay you cash for being so polite and patient with me!"" He asked very nicely, but was quite drunk. After a few more minutes, I called again. He came out and handed me 5 singles and said, ""Here is something, and I promise to take of you much more if you wait."" I have incredible patience for people... so I waited...and waited...and waited. He called me every 5 minutes to make sure I was still there. After almost 30 minutes of total waiting, he came out with two women. (This was my second longest wait ever).

After they got in the car, he started arguing with one of the women about going to another bar. She said ""No! The late night bars are all closed due to coronavirus!"" And they argued in the car for several more minutes, and she stormed out. He asked me to wait again and chased after her as she walked on the sidewalk by a park. They argued for a few more minutes, and then got into the car. He stopped by a gas station on the way, and asked me to wait again. I think he was buying lottery tickets... He came in and asked, ""How much should I give you for being so nice to me?""

I answered back, ""Whatever you feel you wish to give, I'll accept with happiness."" He opened his wallet and gave me another $35. So total of $40 for my patience. I waited all told probably about 35 minutes (at his house before pickup, at the park, and at the gas station), so I guess patience paid off in this case.

post-6451534,immadashellnottakenit...,"Aug 16, 2020 at 2:49 AM","Apparently when a**hole passengers don't want to comply with COVID mandates (wearing face-coverings - or 'properly' wearing one AND KEEPING IT ON!!!!), and/or can't or don't put in the correct address into the APP, then berate you when you call them to mitigate the error (which again, is their mistake...) and, as they all talk over one another, on speakerphone, as if you're their personal property (Oh my God, Julie, she's so stupid! - like that) Lyft allows these passengers to file health violations on you without fair process, no investigation and no tools to help protect us against such false allegations. Anyone else?? 
This (health violations against me as a driver) is received and processed by Lyft as if true, with no statement of facts, no evidence, and no proof, mind you. [If I'm an independent contractor - wouldn't Lyft's processes here be a major overreach and not at all legal? If I'm an employee wouldn't Lyft need to provide a fair and just process to investigate these claims? Once again Lyft cherry-picks processes and policies that do not reflect or support how they have unilaterally chosen to categorize drivers as independent contractors as they simultaneously choose mechanisms that control how we do our job, which includes very inequitable policies and actions brought upon us that are not supported by their claims that we are independent. If I'm independent, let me set my own rates&#8230;and so on&#8230;if I'm independent, then Lyft CANT dictates these things as if I'm their employee. Right?] 
In the case with the wrong address (today), I never even met these women. I never saw them, and they never saw me as far as their statements about how I was in the wrong place goes. I was at the exact place/pin on the map (according to the Lyft APP) yet, apparently, that was the wrong location. And, I never did figure out exactly where they were (due to the talking over one another, the speakerphone on the street, etc.). Yet, when I (an independent contractor) respond to their rudeness (and perhaps their stupidity? after several minutes trying to ascertain their location and fielding their many overlapping conversations, directions, addresses, up until the attitude began to get more directly ruder, etc.), and then finally inform them that I would be canceling the ride due to that rudeness, the account holder beats me to it and cancels; then apparently, nearly immediately, I receive a health violation alert, that threatens to 'suspend my account'! How can I get a health violation from an account holder that I never saw or met and who never saw me? Easy. Lyft's processes and policies are strictly for their benefit only - so they look good as they throw us under the bus.

Making things worse is the fact that Lyft has made responding to these allegations quite laborious, difficult, and time-consuming - for which I do not get paid for btw - and for the fact that these bogus allegations are threatening our livelihood, and our emotional and mental states (it's been VERY UPSETTING!!! VERY!!!). This is negligent and punitive in my estimation. I have had to take time off of the platform to process and respond to these claims which have had very negative effects on me and my income. I'm actually frightened to go back out there; afraid of what someones going to do next. It's so risky as it is, and now this? I feel maligned, disregarded, and without value of any kind. Of course, Lyft has contributed to this with other actions and choices prior to COVID; it's just much more dicey and scary now. COVID has definitely amplified the disfunction and negligence of and from Lyft. Since COVID I've had a passenger throw a drink at me hitting my car (for which nothing was really done and I had no available recourse), I've been threatened many times, I've had many people take their masks off in the car (one woman did her makeup while breathing on me!), I've been lied to every which way you can imagine, given all sorts of promises from passengers that they then fail to fulfill that have either put me directly at risk or took adavantage of me in some way, and generally, l get treated like a piece of sh*t more and more, and my vehicle is getting thrashed. But, Lyft has no process to mitigate those things. And they don't care either.

I've had about 3 of these kinds of health violation retaliations in the last few weeks! It's feeling VERY personal and vindictive. 1st one, Lyft said it was their bad. Great. Of course, I had to take a week off due to that because I was so upset about the false allegation. They offered no details. The 2nd one I have no idea where that stands as Lyft has not been communicating with me (and, quite frankly, they make these processes VERY difficult and laborious for which I do not get paid to unravel!!!). I have no details on that one either. Took some time off for that one too, but went back sooner because I've lost so much income already. Then I get today's. I feel like I have no choice but to do whatever anyone wants to do to me or my car (which is my personal property) no matter how degrading, upsetting, scary or unfair it is if I want the privilege to earn on this platform. I hate this!!

I'm just beside myself here. I fear for my life every time I go out there on the platform, whether it's from COVID or from the bad actions of passengers and the lack of action and fairness from and by Lyft. I'm a sitting duck.

I'm wondering how others are fairing and if anyone has any connections to attorneys in Los Angeles who could help?

P.S. And here's the doozie: Don't forget that Lyft does NOT mandate that passengers use their real and true names, or use a recent real and true photo of themselves, nor are passengers backgrounds checked - yet they're allowed on the platform, and into our personal vehicles that we use for ourselves, our families and our friends and loved ones; and these passengers can wield any accusation against us with Lyft-protected impunity. Meaning, we have no recourse should anything happen to us or our property, or if false claims are alleged - no precautions, no process, no equity. Further, when account holders bring along friends, or allow family members to use their accounts, those passengers also do not have to comply with a real and true name (today I picked up someone named ""Diagnostics"" - not her actual name), photo or background checks. If I'm doing business with someone as an independent contractor or at all, you better bet that I want and will insist on having individuals actual, true, real names and contact information! Why are we not given even that minimal amount of respect? That weakens us. That invalidates us. Lyft has sold us out and set us up for solely their gain, which is made (btw) upon the backs of each and every one of us, while they make all the rules and policies, disenfranchise us, and use us up and spits us out. And, if we are a victim of any of these passengers in any way, we have zero ways of gaining a remedy or a way to be made whole again - simply due to HOW Lyft has set this up and how they dictate this relationship must and will occur. I doubt Lyft does or would do business with folks who don't provide valid company and personal information to them, as that would legally stupid. Yet that's how they've set us up. The bottom line is: Drivers take on the majority of risk without any agency, protections, or back up. We have no benefits and no path to equitable process either. Something to think about.

post-6440416,The Gift of Fish,"Aug 11, 2020 at 7:01 PM","California has been up in arms about Uberlyft's failure to classify its drivers as employees. However, California should accept at least part of the blame for the problems that it alleges, for the simple reason that it allowed Uberlyft to exist in the first place, in spite of the fact that the companies' early operations broke California law.

When Uberlyft appeared, the only way to transport pax on demand was with a taxi. It was not possible to transport pax on demand for less than taxi rates. Then Uberlyft emerged and started their operations, charging pax fares that they themselves set, with no minima imposed on them. Of course, the public loved being driven around for half the cost of a taxi. In the face of public opinion, California acquiesced and changed its laws to accommodate Uberlyft, effectively deregulating on demand for-hire transportation.

We know what happened in the taxi industry before regulation in the early part of the last century. Increasing numbers of taxis pushed fares lower and lower until it got to a point where drivers were not making enough money to survive on, or pay for basics such as being able to take time off, or being able to afford health care. Sound familiar? Fast forward to the 2010s, and we have a repeat of that scenario. Deregulation of for-hire vehicles has led to ever-increasing numbers and oversupply of Uberlyft drivers which, in turn, allowed Uberlyft to reduce driver rates to the extremely low levels they are currently at. 

Now California complains that drivers are unable to make a living working for these companies, but it shows no sign of realising that it allowed this to happen. What did California expect when it deregulated the for-hire transportation industry, disregarding the rates it sets for taxis and allowing the rideshare companies to flood the market with cars at whatever prices they like? It shows a tremendous lack of foresight.",2020

But now the boom is well and truly over and global economies are crashing. Uber's rideshare business has been decimated and its losses are growing larger than ever. On top of all that, California and New York; two of Uber's largest markets, are about to force Uber to pay employee benefits for their drivers. It's not looking good.

Uber currently has $7.8bn remaining in cash and cash equivalent assets. Its current cash burn rate is $2bn per quarter. At this rate, Uber will run out of money in about a year. Conveniently, Dara says that Uber will be profitable by Q4 2021, about a year from now. However, Uber has missed all other promises of profit that it's ever made. And those promises were made - and broken - back when the economy was booming. Dara has given no information on how Uber will reach profitability within the year. It actually looks now like the end of Uber may finally be in sight.

Can Uber suddenly and magically find a path to profit in spite of all of the above before the money runs out? How? Or are they just rearranging the deck chairs at this point?

post-6441486,Young Kim,"Aug 12, 2020 at 3:55 AM","Due to the downtown lootings in Chicago yesterday, Uber was tough today. It was hard and next to impossible to get to certain pickup locations today, because of yesterday's lootings downtown. A lot of streets were closed, even I think up north. I was driving get into downtown from the South Loop and all the exits appeared to be closed until you passed downtown. Traffic was really bad. I heard the bridges were up as well. I believe that due to caution, even some of the malls up north had closed streets. I had an UberEats pickup today at a Red Lobster and as I tried to get close to the restaurant, you couldn't turn left onto Touhy from McCormick. So I entered the parking lot, and again, blocked. Then I steered around counterclockwise...still blocked. Had to finally cancel the request because I saw no way to get to my pickup location. The looters last night made an entire city gridlocked, and made it painfully difficult for me to get to my pickups. I hope the looters reflect on what they did and realize they didn't just cause broken windows and stolen goods. . ",2020

post-6436789,FLKeys,"Aug 10, 2020 at 11:51 AM","Over the weekend I get a comfort pick-up request and when I see the name my first thought was email scam. You know, the ones that promise you millions. Pick-up is at one of the high end resorts and was a 22 minute ride. I get there and see a person that just screams prince, I get a small chuckle from my earlier email scam thought. He was dressed very similar to below. He also had a couple leather bags that just looked expensive, similar to the ones below.

It was obvious it was the first time he used Uber as he asked me several questions on how to use it.

We get talking and he was upset there was no limo service available, and the resort he booked (avg $459 per night) was a dump. He took a limo from the airport to the resort. I ask him where he was visiting from and he tells me Nigeria. I laugh to myself, Nigerian Prince, they do exist. His destination is another high end resort that charges around $1000 per night.

Really nice guy mainly just talked about things to do while he was in town for a week and what my favorite restaurants were. He wanted to go offshore fishing so I gave him a card for one of the captains I know, the card has a unique identifier on it and every 6 offshore trips booked from my identifier earns me a free 1/2 day offshore trip. I have done 2 fishing trips now.

He dropped me a $100 tip, been a while since I got a $100 tip, think that makes my 3rd in the nearly 2.5 years I have been doing ride share. I suspect I won't get anymore rides from him as the resort I took him to has their own car service.

post-6426539,MyJessicaLS430,"Aug 6, 2020 at 2:31 AM","I had 4 kid's meals as my first delivery of the day. Usually I cancel whenever an order is not ready for pick up. This time is an exception since I wanted to grab some kolaches near by. After coming back for the order, the person apologized saying that he needed more time for the chicken tenders. Wait! What? What kind of mother is that ordering chicken tenders for 4 children in the morning?

The mother Barbara has left a very detailed direction to her apartment. When I arrive, I could not see the keypad as mentioned. She had the nerve to tell me to enter through the guest entrance and bring 2 bags of kid's meals to her on foot under 90oF. No. This is not going to happen. After the count-down had started, I reclined my seat looking forward to claim those chicken tenders.




As I was about to turn off the hazard light, somebody honked behind me. Then I saw a woman walking toward my car. 'For Barbara?' she asked. I stared at her for a few seconds without saying a word. She then asked 'Are you postmate?' Here is my reply - Very interesting. You told me to walk to your apartment but you drive to me. Fortunately, I am not dumb enough to walk. She explained that there are separate gates for entry and exit. Before she finishes, I said 'You want your food or not?' Not interested in her nonsense. Why didn't she tell me to meet at the exit gate then?

Curse me all she wants. Unlike Eats, there is no rating system. Go and @@@@ yourself Barbara. As expected, no tip. Want to know the funny part? She put a chicken tender into her mouth soon after the bags had left my hands! I feel sorry for her kids LOL

I've come to the conclusion that the room is rented permanent, as her office. She leaves for work, kissing her kids goodnight, goes to the motel and changes to her ""work clothes"".

Last night, I got a call, about 1:30 AM. The trip was to a Wing Stop. In a shopping center, supermarket and all. The parking lot was empty, except for 6 or so cars for the grocery workers. She walked right in to the restaurant, door was unlocked, and another girl arrived soon after. This is 2/3 times I've delivered to this restaurant at this hour.

I’m dropping off a pax when I get a text from my queued up pax, ‘I’ll be out front in blue scrubs.’ Which makes sense because I’m headed to a medical park.

So I get there and no blue scrubs to be seen, but I’m right on top of the pin so I wait.

Couple of minutes later pax in the blue scrubs comes running out, yes running, and into my car.

Away we go and I ask her the same question I ask all pax, ‘so how’s your day going so far?’ 

She says, enthusiastically I might add, ‘I just sent my boss an ‘I quit’ email before getting in your car.‘ (that explains the running to the car lol) So with that statement alone, she just went to the top of the charts for greatest pax ever in my book.

She went on to describe this mentally abusive doc who treats all the nurses and staff like shit. Someone else left the previous week, and as an example of office culture the Christmas gathering last year was to announce health insurance was being cut.

Pax calls a Lyft
Pax types an ‘I quit’ in an email to Dr Frankenstein and cc’s Human Resources 
Pax leaves the building and enters Lyft

post-6428634,Eco-Charles,"Aug 6, 2020 at 11:48 PM","Looking at all the threads complaining on here about tips, I'll share my history being a ""bad tipper"".

Late 80's-early 90's, Domino's had a if it's not delivered in 30 or 60 minutes (forget which) it's free. We would be complete clowns and block the streets to get free food......never thinking of the driver who got no tip. This ended when a co-worker had a husband that had delivered to me several times....ouch!

As an adult... if I called a place for delivery and they said 20-40-60-2000 minutes I would be fine unless it was late then no tip. The same goes for calling back and asking if they were running behind when they said 40 minutes and now it's 80 minutes and they say another 10 minutes and the driver shows up in another hour=no tip. 

Asking for something that's really important to me like hot mustard for Chinese food or blue cheese for wings. I'll stress and stress that I need extra hot mustard, if none, I can't eat that garage and don't tip. Sort of like going to a bar and asking for a Jack and coke and the Jack didn't come but they can bring it back in 40-60 minutes. 

So basically, if you delivered to me, you had zero 0% chance of determining your tip. Aside from being weird and mowing my yard, everyone else set you up for failure or my base tip of $5 and much more in crappy weather for a 5 minute delivery. 

Just food for thought if you get a bad tip, it prolly might not be your fault. 

I'll extend my thought process to inside dining. If the waitstaff says service might be a little slow or very slow because of this or that like short staff, they get a full and nice tip. If they say nothing and we complain several times over what should be a 40 minute dining experience that turns into 2.5 hours the tip will suffer. The ONLY thing that can really hurt the tip of a waitperson is being the type that knows they will earn 15-30% and they just don't care anything about service.......then they get a nice long winded note explaining exactly why they got the tip left. 

On a side note, I bartended for years, my daughter is in the food service/bartending industry and I might get into driving now.",2020

Small apartment complex pull in and don't see anyone waiting. I'm there 1:30 and send a message I arrived. at 2:00 I send I am parked in front of the office. I see messages delivered and read. No response. At 5:01 I cancel for no show and pull into a parking spot. 2 Minutes later I get a second ping same address of course the timer starts right away as I'm already there. 1:15 my phone rings. Lady says I cancelled on her and the people I am picking up are still there waiting for me. I tell her I am in the same place I said I was in the message I sent her and that I waited 5 minutes with no response so I cancelled. She says she has no idea where the office is and the kids are at Apt 25. I ask her how old are the kids and she hangs up on me. It is almost 5 minutes now and I see the kids standing near the road. I pull up to them and see they are clearly under 18 and they have no masks. 5:00 is up I cancel for a second cancel fee. As I'm pulling out I get a third ping from her. Of course I accept and pull back in to the apartment complex. Mom calls I don't answer. Mom sends a text, please call me. I wait until the timer hits 2 minutes and before I can call she is calling me. I answer and she goes off on me in a polite way (no cursing) when she stops I tell her I cancelled the second time because Uber does not permit me taking unattended minors and they also did not have any masks on. So mom is fine I'll cancel this time and hands up on me. Bingo I hit the Trifecta, 3 cancel fees from one Pax.

I continue on my way home and get another ping about 5 minutes later. Rider cancels right away. 1 minute later ping, same person, they cancel right away again. Another minute goes by and I get a third ping from them, immediately get a message ""Stop taking my calls *****!"" and they cancel a third time.

I get home and select the last ride of the 3 cancels and report it to Uber, I tell them the rider was abusive and obviously discriminating against me.

Nice young lady, 19 living on her own, works 3 jobs. No problem, slip on my shoes and head out the door. Get there and see her walking out of the gated community toward me. I say good morning XXXXXX where we going today? She tells me and I am thinking strange that is about 14 minutes SW not 6 minutes NE. I start the trip and of course the address does not match where she said she was going. I tell her she needs to change the address in the app.

She says what app? I tell her the Uber app. She says I did not call Uber I called a Taxi like I always do, your the Taxi, you picked me up several times already. I tell her I know I have picked you up several times, all through the Uber app. She responds I always call a Taxi I have never used Uber. I told her hold on and try calling the PAX trough the App. No answer after several rings. Try calling again, immediately to voice mail.

I tell her I am not a Taxi and have never worked for a Taxi, she has a very confused look on her face. She tells me she paid $48 on Apple Pay for the ride already. I tell her the ride should cost her around $30 not $48. I then tell her that this ""Taxi Company"" she is calling must be acting as a middle man and requesting rides for her via Uber. I told her if she can't change the address I'll have to end the trip. She calls the Taxi company and now they won't answer her either. She would not tell me the name of the Taxi company. 

She gets out and I end the trip instead of cancel it so I have a record of it to report back to Uber. I get my minimum fare ride and head back home. Before I get home 2 minutes away Uber adjusts the trip to $0.00. I click on the trip and and then trip issues and adjustments. Report my issue and instantly get an adjustment to $1.55 more than the minimum fare amount. Click on details and see Uber just paid me PAX paid nothing.

Told her to contact uber support or I can just take the hit. She said that I don't want you to lose your job since you doing a good job etc.. please help me change it. I send the same thing on inapp chat. But I already had a bad feeling about this. And at end of delivery I just gave the account owner a thumb down. As I expect after an hour, NO TIP for a great job.

I was sitting at a hotel waiting on PAX to get in the car and another Uber pulls up next to me.The driver gets out of his blue van and he has a Polo shirt on, The Left half was Pink and the right half was Black. On the left sleeve and front breast area were White Lyft Logos and on the right sleeve and breast area there were Uber Logos.

I laughed the rest of the night. What a dedicated driver. I have seen his van around many times, I'm going to try and get a picture of him.",2020

Anyone have this issue you report them to Uber with the no mask, Then the passenger retaliates against you and Reports you not wearing a mask? 

My new deal is when they try to open the door without mask i am going to drive by them and cancel the ride and give them the bird.",2020

post-6399466,Young Kim,"Jul 25, 2020 at 1:21 AM","I had a suburban couple during the afternoon in Glenview, IL who I dropped off to their friends' home in Mount Prospect, IL, and they voiced a very strong feeling that the public is ""being had"". They are in the minority of my passengers, but I was intrigued by their intense feelings. They are self employed and own a sports memorabilia company where they make stuff with professional teams' logos. Like shirts, mugs, picture frames with sports' logo designs, etc. stuff like that. They asked me if I personally knew anyone with Covid or had Covid. Before I could even answer, they said, ""Of course you haven't!"" (Actually I had... some of my other passengers). They were (for lack of a better word) outraged. I am sure you have heard such stories before. That this virus is just another ""annual flu"", and stuff like that. And that doing what we are doing is going to cause much greater casualties down the line (from illness, suicide, etc.).

(Edit...I was just dropping off another passenger so I did not have time to write more), but they discussed how this virus is a ""hoax"" in that it is being used to allow the massive transfer of wealth, the greatest in history. They mentioned that the trillions mostly went to big corporations and rich individuals under the PPP and to prop up the stock market. And it was discussed that the stock market benefits disproportionately the very wealthy. They conceded after I then shared with them many passengers I personally had who either had the virus or knew someone directly who had the virus, that there could be a real Covid-19 virus, but that the disease is being blown way out of proportion to take wealth away from the masses and give mostly to the rich... and take from the following unborn generations of Americans. (end edit). 

What do you say to people who are expressing this view? I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I never dismiss anyone's opinion outright. Could there be something that we are not being told which is hidden (an extreme view). Or... is what we are doing as a world causing a ""ripple effect"" that may greater loss of life that we have yet to manifest? As I wrote before, I will follow (but not blindly) the conventional narrative simply because I don't feel I have any authority or knowledge that could refute said narrative. But I am always cautious, because the masses of people have been misled by those in power in the past. And I am sure will be in the future as well...",2020

Everyone is already sitting on the side of the street I need in the afternoon to stay cool.

In front of 5+ story condos is the best usually, but we've got some huge 60+ year old shade trees on almost every block where I hang out, and those work pretty good too.

I had to sit in the sun today for almost an hour mid afternoon because everyone was home it seemed (working remotely ?)..........:speechless:............it was 85 degrees, and those black leather seats I've got were not my first choice.

post-6380433,LyftUberFuwabolewa,"Jul 16, 2020 at 10:52 PM","After more than 14,000 rides I've had it happen twice where when I pull up to a customer who has some kind of cargo they demand I open the back and remain in the car and let them load the cargo.

Both times the riders were females.

The first time it happened the woman told me to stay in the car, I did not, she voiced some displeasure and I acted like I didn't hear her.

Today I pull up and the woman barks at me ""what's your name?"" I told her my name. Since her daughter had a large bag of sports equipment I hit the button to open the back and started getting out. Mom barks at me to stay in the car.

I hesitated and then got out. She again crabbily told me to get back in the car. At that point I told her I didn't want the ride. I explained that I want to see what's being loaded in my car and I want to be sure it's loaded right. At this point she mouth off and says that she was just trying to do me a favor but I can tell you her attitude was total *****.

At no point did she smile or have any kindness in her tone.

You guys know how it is, nobody's going to treat your car as you would. You'll let them load their own luggage into your car and they carelessly throw it in hitting the body and bumper on the way in and then just throwing it into your vehicle.

It really disgusts me the people who treat our vehicles like there's some kind of public transportation bus or train and not like it's our personal possession which we care about.

They want us to come with the car that's in perfect condition and spotlessly clean and then they want to treat it and dirty it however they want.

Have you guys ever had this situation where someone demands you remain seated in the driver seat while they load their stuff into your vehicle? How did you handle it?",2020

I started physical therapy tonight and was very surprised at how much range of motion I actually have in my hand and fingers after being in a cast for five weeks. The bones have healed really nicely, and I should be back to typing my 80 words per minute within a month.

Areas marked with diagonals are to be avoided (poorly-paved roads / hoods / high crime zones). The love marks indicate hotspots where you can find quality rides. Boxes marked with 'X tip' is pretty self-explanatory which also coincide with low rider quality. This gives everyone across America an idea of how cheap the majority of 'Houstonians' are. Interesting enough, I have never received any ride requests in regions marked with question marks. Perhaps someone from Houston can share his / her experience.




Below indicates how 'pristine' the roads are in Houston. Pray if you drive a car with air-suspension.

1) Westheimer Rd spanning from Loop 610 to DT Houston
2) Richmond Av. This road is @@@@ed the entire length
3) Bellaire Blvd between I-69 and Chimney Rock Rd
4) Bissonnet St spanning from Loop 610 to I-69
5) North and South Braeswood Blvd. As @@@@ as #2, eastbound toward medical centre is even worse
6) Buffalo Speedway between Holcombe Blvd and Loop 610
7) Cambridge St
8) Fountain View Dr
9) South Gessner Rd. Pretty @@@@. This road is so long that I have never been to either ends.




Hope this may become useful for any rookies in Houston or anyone here who wishes to visit Houston in the future.

post-6395388,The Jax,"Jul 23, 2020 at 11:10 AM","I have been delivering over 20 years and over 7 with the apps. This one is a head scratcher...

I get a typical order for Honeygrow. Nothing special. Head over to the customer. Get a text from the customer on my way. They asked if I could just park in front of house when I arrived and text them and they would come out. This is being delivered in a nicer middle class neighborhood.

As I arrive, a late teen girl walks out the front door and closes it before I text. Appears to be 17 to 19 years old. I say hello and ask her if she was the one who ordered. She responds with, ""Do you like Banquet frozen dinners? Or do you like On-cor?"". I pause as this was not what I was expecting out of the customer's mouth. I then replied, ""Well I haven't eaten frozen dinners in years so I do not really know. Are you giving some away?"". So pauses and looks up and around and then says, ""Wow, its super hot today. I think I need to take off my shoes"". She then takes off her sandals (they were the gladiator type) and then says ""Hey, do you mind holding onto these for a minute? I will be right back"" so I am like, ""Uhhhh ok?"" and she then leans in my car and puts them on my passenger seat then starts walking behind my car and across the street.

There a few younger boys playing outside, like middle school age. The girl just walks over and picks up one of their bikes and they are like, ""Hey, what are you doing!!!"" and she rides away and they try and chase after her but give up. So I am like, wtf. So I get out of the car and knock on the door. The same door the girl just exited from a few minutes ago. A woman in her 40's I think, answers the door. I ask her about the delivery. She said no one ordered food and that there was no one by that name living there. I asked her if she had a daughter or younger family member that lived there with them or was staying there and she said no. I explained to her that a girl just exited her house that looked like the person I just described and the woman got very worried and said that she had no one in the house today besides her, that she knows of. Well ok?

I start to walk back to my car and those boys are outside yelling and freaking out and one of the kid's dads are there. So as I am getting in my car, I ask them if they knew who the girl was. The one boy said, ""No! And she just stole my bike!"".

So I drive away and before I contact support I get a text and its the girl. She asked if I left and I said yes. She says meet me at the park a few blocks down. I head over and she asks for her shoes back and the food. I give them to her and she gives me a $40 cash tip. She then gets back on the bike with her shoes on and the food and just disappears.

I completed the delivery on the app then moved on. No idea what the hell that was even about. This was not some trashy looking girl or a girl who looked like she was on drugs or used drugs. I can't even begin to assume what was up there.",2020
