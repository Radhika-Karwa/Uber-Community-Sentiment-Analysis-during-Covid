As some know here I decided to go and get a real job like my wife had been suggesting

You know a W No I dont care if you dont want to flip burgers 

Well I thought that I was doing pretty well driving Uber after expenses still about what I earned as a paramedic but my  Civic hit k and gas prices are through the roof

So real job

Back to EMS Still a maybe But Im not in my s anymore a touch of PTSD and two hernias

Back to programming Competitive also for the young and I do not want to be behind a desk

Law enforcement That was on my horizon before we moved to the big city and stuff happened

So one night I decided to send a Facebook message to a limousine company that I first noticed before I started rideshare full time brand new to the city life Instant reply I was hired on the spot two days later

First vehicle I drove was a Chrysler  Brakes were shot Second another  tires were bald and one had an enormous chunk of rubber missing

Soul searched for about three days and posted here Decided to give them the benefit of doubt just as I would want emailed them basically saying that they are awesome but I cant drive unsafe shit

Owners girlfriend stepped in took care of everything like a boss and I am now driving their best The pandemic nearly killed their business that section of the fleet is just now becoming more in demand

Now Winifred She had just become a regular when I started  very well to do First trip was from an independent care facility now assisted living unit shes not happy to the afternoon Mass

I was warned in advance and given a salute by her last driver before I headed to pick her up  third trip for the company Very demanding pax and she needs a lot of help getting in and out of the car

She asked me to do five things at once said shes old enough to be my grandmother Moms her age AC was either too hot or too cold and made me pull over to find the right radio station All in the first five minutes 

First time waiting for a pax on the job People were commenting on the fancy car parked by the door to the church It was her first Mass since the pandemic began

After I got her situated in the car again she started to apologize for how she acted before I cut her off Told her that I know chronic pain when I see it arthritic obese and how it can definitely  with your mood And I told her to stop calling herself old

Dropped her off called the company and told them that if Winifred ever needs a ride to PLEASE let me know And she requested me for her next trip

Mass again yesterday this time I joined her Boss asked if we needed to charge extra for an escort 

And thats my Sunday moving forward Paid a decent amount to drive a friend Winifred said Id better not think of her as a pax to church and back

Oh and here I am picking up her phone off of the road yesterday because I put it on the roof and forgot Not a scratch Divine intervention




Rideshare has been either extremely profitable here or less than minimum wage just seems to be how the wind blows Tips are pretty much unheard of pick up distance is still pretty high for most pings Pax are still left stranded at our airport

Even though Im not totally down with it seems a bit low I earn hr from when I leave the garage that can be home if the car isnt needed before or between trips until I return

unlike Uber and Lyft tips are included minimum of   and many fares are  So no dead miles and no expenses Lately driving a  Lincoln MKT  Continental  Suburban and soon a  Continental

Pax run the gamut from Winifred to newlyweds executives flight crews airport to hotel and back organ transplant teams and  last week  a show creator for AMC followed by his lead actor

I was star struck enough then had the surreal experience of the main man behind the show asking me to stop so he could literally run a block to an ATM so he could tip me  cash in addition to the  or so included short airport run

In conclusion companies like this are hiring Oh rideshare drivers are un employable  bullshit I submitted a resume showed up on time wearing a suit heres where the keys are water bottles are over there when can you start  that was the interview

So if you are burnt out being an ant hate that term but whatever consider the option And Im part time for now still anting on and off

"Uber badly wants me to drive again It keeps sending incentive notices to my inbox So as it happens I have been driving Since last in the saddle I have lost Gold status and my ability to see the destination of a ride request is now based upon the newish accepting  of  ride requests algo

On the surface the of algo seems to me like a halfway decent compromise giving drivers up front details if they simply maintain a  acceptance rate Of course drivers who accept a smaller percentage of rides will note that the low pay makes the of algo a joke But even in my locale where Uber still pays  cents a mile and  cents a minute the of algo is a clown act As anyone who has focused on the algo knows acceptance rate is based upon each individual ride request rather than on passenger request

The downside of this nuanced difference played out for me yesterday with Darren Darren wanted a ride Badly His request for a long ride on the Lyft platform came to me and I declined it For my own good reasons I was unable to accommodate a pax who wanted a ride out of town After all I am an Independent Contractor and it is my right to choose which rides work for me Darren then came in on the Uber app which I also declined lowering my  of  acceptance rate one notch Undaunted for the next half hour Darren toggled back and forth between platforms requesting his outoftown ride

Uber in all its wisdom kept sending me Darrens requests The algo was too dumb to realize that if I turned the request down once nothing was going to change  minutes later But the requests kept coming and I noticed my acceptance rate was dropping with each successive decline Finally while on another ride Darrens request came in again Only this time there was no destination I didnt realize the request was from stubborn Darren and stupidly accepted it

I drive the  minutes to the pickup point then down a  mile dirt road which cakes the back of my freshly washed car with dust only to realize after starting the ride that my pax was the now infamous Darren Darren Im so sorry I cant drive you to xxx I know theres not a lot of Uber cars on duty right now being that a lot of drivers are still preferring UI but I just cant do it Darren whose family is just starting up a pot farm replies in a most mellow way that it is totally cool and to just drop him back to his pickup location I do and move on

We have been having promotions every day  per ride so our small downtown area where the promotion applies is flooded with drivers You can sit around and wait for one of the promo rides or if you want to make money you can take what comes your way and hopefully a few of the very short  rides will come your way as well Yesterday I took a  minute pick up at our airport for a  minute ride Normally and especially during these promotions I get in touch with the rider and make sure that he is coming back towards the downtown area  of the time that would be the case if they say theyre going North or West towards Harrisonburg I would probably cancel I dont want to end up  minutes away from the downtown area and possibly deadhead all the way back In this case I got no answer on my text and assuming that the guy was probably waiting for his bag or just on the phone I went ahead to the pick up anyway Surprise Going north to Ruckersville Shit Oh well Took him home  ride and  tip OK Set destination back to downtown and luckily got two trips along the return one short and one all the way back downtown Both of these tipped feeling lucky and good at this point Then I got the phone call My airport passenger thinks he left his phone in my car I look around the back and there it is under the seat on the side where he dropped it His girlfriend is smoking hot and not shy by the way Kids this is why you should lock your phones So I made the honest and well intentioned mistake of telling him that I found it This nice guy with the hot girlfriend immediately turned into an entitled jerk and demanded that I return my property to him at his house which is now more than  minutes away from my location At this point I had already accepted another trip so I told him to call me back in half an hour A few minutes later I got in touch with support and they confirmed to me that since I had informed the passenger and Uber that I found his property I was now obligated to return it to him Good Lord what a freaking nightmare Surge popping up on top of the promotion in the downtown area its heating up as people are starting to return to their hotels and homes from going out to eat Im going to miss making some really good money if I drive all the way out to this dudes house again He calls me again for the th time He is getting upset and is very pushy continues to demand that I drive to his home and return his property I push my luck and fib tell him that I cannot possibly drive all the way to Ruckersville as Im at the end of my shift After a near meltdown he acquiesces and agrees to meet me half way I suggest Walmart and he finally agrees Walmart is fortunately much farther for him than for me so I came out OK on this Drove to Walmart did a little shopping met the guy in front returned his phone and he didnt say a word no thank you nothing What a jerk and lesson learned never again will I admit to finding a phone from a distant drop off and never again will I drop anyone off at a distance without thoroughly checking around the back seat After over  trips I know better this was a stupid mistake But I got my  returned item fee and after another long talk with support they also added a bonus  promotion to my account,0.981,0.063,0.827,0.11,Positive,0.12,0.07,0.22,0.26,0.33,2021,Cvillegordo

"I picked up an Uber Eats order from a discount restaurant

As Im about to arrive at the customers apartment a phone call comes in I figure its the customer who wants to give me special instructions to get to their place so I answer

Turns out its the restaurant manager He said he was not watching the front desk and his employee forgot to give me the drinks that went with the order

I tell him to refund the drinks and Im not coming back because I dont get paid to go back and deliver the drinks and besides its his employees responsibility to give me the correct order

He tells me its between the customer and Uber and its my responsibility to get the order right too I tell him not only was his employee rude but not to blame me for his employees mistake

He tells me to tell the customer that I forgot his drinks I tell him Im done talking to him to have a good night and hang up the phone At this point Im pretty irritated and basically had already raised my voice when he blamed me for the mistake

Yeah I know I could have checked for drinks but when an employee hands me an order Im going to assume its correct Every once in a while I do check orders for drinks and occassionally I do catch errors but Im not going to waste my time and check the accuracy of orders everytime especially if  of the time the orders are correct anyway which is my satisfaction rate after this order

What I didnt realize until I hung up is that the restaurant can actually give you negative feedback and when I checked my rating for deliveries sure enough the manager dinged me Apparently the customer dinged me tooabout  minutes after I checked my rating from the merchant my customer satisfaction rating had dropped from  to which I suspect happened when the customer called the restaurant and the manager blamed me for the mistake

Anyway I came really close for telling the manager to F Off so Im glad I kept my cool 

So if you ever find yourself of the situation first off dont be an idiot like me and answer your phone like I did and if you do answer the phone be careful what you say to the store manager Having said that you arent a store employee and if they try to blame you for their employee screwing up tell them to shove it because at the end of the day its on them and not you",0.9182,0.078,0.815,0.107,Positive,0.15,0.06,0.28,0.2,0.31,2021,Haanjo

"Dear Ridershare Passengers

When Im waiting for you I will wait  minutes Not  minutes and one second  minutes is  minutes I only get paid roughly  cents per minute of wait time and while Im waiting for you Im missing out on other rides 

And dont say you will tip me extra because often people who say that dont tip at all For the record sometimes I get paid more for cancelling the ride than I do for the ride itself and keep in mind Im often parked in an odd spot waiting for you sometimes blocking traffic and sometimes dealing with drunk idiots who are trying to steal your ride

And for the record I understand that sometimes you need to pay your tab at the bar before you can leave I get that But you had a  minute notice for me to get there while I was finishing up my last ride plus another  minute notice while I was on my way to pick you up after dropping off my last passenger

So there is no excuse to not be waiting at the curb when I pull up And for the record when I started doing rideshare three and a half years ago I used to bend over backwards for my passengers like you But often five minutes would turn into ten minutes and when I bent over backwards for my passengers the most you would be a bad passenger things would go terribly wrong on the ride and you would give me a one star rating for my efforts

Over  rides later Ive learned from riders like you 

When you say stuff like

Be right there

What you really mean is that you are going to be late And if Ive been patient enough to wait for you for the entire  minutes and beyond no you cant smoke a cigarette before we leaveget in the freaking car

So there you have it Id like to be a nice guy and wait but you need to show some courtesy and respect for your driver and not sit there and socialize with your friend up until the last possible second because once I hit the gas pedal and start to take off its too late and yelling at me to come back isnt going to change things

And for the record it took something like  rides with  late passengers to develop this attitude Bottom line is Im not messing around anymore So be ready

"Pax have been holding court talking smack and spilling the tea so to say about all the kinds of drivers they really dont like and why they give one stars and complaints 

Here are some most common categories pax seem to talk about

 The oddball Sure it goes without saying that RS would attract its share of societys outliers ie those who need to pay the bills but cant manage a W gig but some seem to take it one step beyond to the point of turning off or even freaking out pax Stand out examples according to pax include one guy who had a pit bull riding shotgun service dog who knows a woman who kept addressing a male pax as Martha even after he corrected her and another lady who had the inside of her car decked out with pulsing disco lights 

 The maniac on the streets Its one thing to drive like a bat out of hell to hustle to the drop off ASAP but completely another to almost cause multiple accidents get into an unsparring amount of altercations both verbal and physical with other drivers on the road until pax pleads to end the ride early and be let off at the nearest corner Not good for The Community

 The slob No pax likes getting into strangers car which looks and smells like a junk yard Even if their own car is that way or worse they wont tolerate it when Ubering or Lyfting pax complain the some drivers car get super gross and they have roll the windows because of the funky odordrivers grouse about pax eating in their cars but a number of drivers as reported by pax are the ones munching away with a sandwich andor burrito in hand while driving food slipping everywhere Clearly a one star ride there 

 The antisocial introvert Many of us yours truly included remain open to talking shop with a pax about this and that to establish rapport to pull down a tip So its surprising how many drivers dont work that tip and instead simply unlock the door set the GPS and drive in total silence arrive unlock door doneno greeting and welcome confirmation of name and destination hows it going etc nothing And Im not talking about members of the Deaf Community who are drivingI mean the folks who take the whole our job is just to just to drive pax from point A to point B ethos a bit too literally One pax recounted how they get into the car told her driver good morning and received a grunt as a response followed by glowering stare through the mirror She canceled the ride I might have too

Moneywise Id say this gig isnt worth it I think we pay too much fixing our cars and putting gas into them My previous job didnt pay that much though So its not like I left a K job for this or something Also you dont get alot of time off doing rideshare People dont respect rideshare drivers and we put alot of work into it Honestly I cant say I blame them after taking a few rides from other drivers

"Picked up a guy at a new apartment complex and took him about  minutes up the road this morning 

A couple of minutes into the ride he appeared to be getting agitated sighing etc I did have to go backwards a little bit before heading towards the destination because of the nature of the several lane road etc but nothing too out of the ordinary 

About halfway through the ride he asked if he could roll down the window I said sure no problem and I cracked mine as well to avoid the reverb I asked him if it was too hot and he said no my AC was set to an appropriate level

I dont think he was concerned about COVID because he wasnt wearing a mask until right before he got into my car I did have an almost full cup of very strong coffee but Ive never gotten a complaint about that and even regular compliments on the aroma

I dropped him off at his destination and then it dawned on me the egg salad sandwich I had purchased at a convenience store and placed on the passenger seat was giving off an aroma If he had smelled it through the coffee aroma he probably thought I was a gassy driver I moved the sandwich to the hatchback before picking up my next pax

Waiting for a bad rating or even a complaint but I hope to avoid it He was a  like me so hopefully he gives me the benefit of the doubt

"I was in a hellish part of town the other night in an area with a lot of bars and restaurants Typically the pax just want you to shuttle them from one bar to another which isnt worth the headache But I figured Id go ahead and play the role of good ant and accepted the request 

I find the location of the pickup and decided I didnt want to be that ant and hold up traffic waiting for my pax So I pull off into a side street and wait parked next to the building right at the pincushion I sat there waiting for my pax when  clowns decided for whatever reason to stand right next to my passenger door somewhat inhibiting my view and peoples view of my vehicle Attempted to contact the pax several times no answer 

Five minutes later stupid Comfort  minute wait and still no sign of her Look over and the  jackasses are still just standing there One of the asshats decides he wants to lean his hand on my car to which I slowly put the car in reverse and clip his arm with my side mirror With the windows rolled up I still manage to hear him say You couldve asked I responded in turn with Get off my  car I was actually hoping that theyd start something as I was already getting frustrated by the most likely drunk woman making me wait But they just decided to walk down the street with no drama 

Im not sure what planet that dillhole was from where he actually thought that I needed to ASK him to get off my car Its not a park bench its my personal property ya schmuck

Last night I had a Lyft pickup at a pool billiards bar at around  am

After about a minute and a half of waiting a guy comes out and says Wow you were fast not realizing he had been in my que for close to  minutes and was less than  miles from my last drop off He then goes back into the bar

At around the  minute mark he comes back out and says he is waiting for his friend and proudly says he will make it worth my while if I wait I simply respond with the universal ok ok At that point I explain to him that he has about  secondsand he runs into the bar to get his friend

The clock ticks down to zero and he still hasnt shown up so naturally I bolt With around  Uber and Lyft rides to date I no longer mess around Im serious when I say you have  seconds

As I take off I hear him yell That wasnt  seconds sir but the reality is that it was closer to  secondsor more accurately  minutes and five seconds or so

I dont get why so many people take so long to get ready In my case whenever I book Lyft ride Im ready before the driver gets to my pickup location In this case I get that my rider was probably finishing up a game of pool but at this stage of the game I dont put up with the BS I put up with when I was a new driver and I wont hesitate to leave you behind if you are not ready or if you chose to socialize with your friends for even  minutesI will not hesitate to leave you behind if you dont give me the same respect as I given other Lyft drivers when they pick me up

This video shows the entire ride start to finish I sped up the parts with no dialogue Heres a summary

  greeting and confirmation of destination Pax has an obvious bad attitude from the start
  Pax sends me a text through app I dont like your music name I ask her You dont like my music You want me to turn it off to which she remains silent I switch off the radio At this point I start to worry about this pax This was the most bizarre thing to happen during my  rides
end  I ask the pax So now Im curious what kind of music do you like to listen to to which she responds I dont have any interest in speaking with you Thats when I pulled over to cancel the ride Thats when the fireworks happen

Notes  I have a big obvious wedding band on my ring finger I dont flirt with pax and this one wasnt even attractive  We had listened to Beatles Here Comes The Sun but apparently she really didnt like listening to Pink Martinis rendition of Bolero  I am starting a new job very soon so my tolerance for pax bullshit is at an alltime low None of them ever get to treat me like The Help in my own car ever again Deactivation from a false accusation from her or from posting this video online I dont care

Weekend started off bad with my rd trip being and Uber Scammer Ill post more about that in Uber Eats

Had more cancels this past weekend than I have had so far this year

First cancel Friday Night this guy was way to drunk to be getting in my car Here is a series of screen shots from my dash cam Easy pass he actually fell again when he got past my front bumper giving me room to drive off Luckily he fell away from my car

Two more cancels Friday night where PAX texted me just before the  minutes was up that they were on the way I was not in the mood to pick up people that made me wait Waited out timer and drove off with cancel fee Ended up calling it a night out of frustration and headed home

Saturday started out okay Fridays Uber Eats episode still lingering I opted not to turn eats on the rest of the weekend Soon the cancels started rolling in  for the day  PAX cancelled as I arrived at pickup point  I cancelled for No Show The final cancel was this little peach Hard to see her in the picture boy friend is leaning over her as she is puking out her guts Good Bye let someone else deal with that




Last trip Saturday night pickup at a wedding property and take a couple to their resort They were discussing that they need to leave at  AM to get to the airport on time Non eventful  mile trip I head toward my next pickup and see flashing lights in my mirror for a brief second Than nothing Get to my pickup and the guy gets in and says hey someone left their phone Damn bet that was the flashing light I saw Drop them off pretty close to resort I dropped last couple off at Select found item option and previous trip Used call PAX option and sure enough it was his phone as it started ringing Went by their cottage at the resort and knocked on door No answer Oh well left a note on their door to contact Uber Turned phone off and put it in an electronics bag so they could not track it to my house

Get up early Sunday looking for an airport trip or two Get a ping that just looks funny no addresses that I recognize I accept and start to get ready to walk out the door I get a text message saying please call me I call PAX and he tells me where he is at He wants me to come pick him up some  miles away an take him to Aventura some  miles away He proceeds to tell me the app keeps telling him no drivers available where he is at so he kept randomly putting in trips I tell him I cant drive  miles un paid for a trip that will take me  miles from where I live He says tell me what address to put in that is close to where I am at and he will put in a multi stop trip to come get him take him to Aventura and he will take care of my return miles A couple of minutes later I get pickup updated so I continue out the door Trip started  minute from my house to  miles south for first stop

I was passing the resort from PAX that left phone in my car so I stopped and knocked on door again I also had already turned the phone back on to see if they would try and call it My note was still there and I knew they were planning on leaving in about an hour and I would be on a long trip and not able to return the phone No answer Oh well off I go to pickup my PAX About  minutes away from my pickup the left phone rings I answer it and pretty much tell the guy he is out of luck as I was on a long trip Told him I would ask my PAX I was picking up if they minded if I stopped to drop the phone off Told him to call back in  minutes

Get to the stop and a guy comes out and says he needs a few minutes and says thanks for going out of your way and slips me some cash I ask him if he was okay with me dropping of the phone he was sure that is fine I look at the cash he hands me a very very generous tip As Im waiting at his Ocean front house I notice the multiple high end cars couple of antique jeeps  sizeable boats  wave runners and two crotch rockets Man this guy is not hurting for cash at all A few minutes later he comes out with a piece of eye candy in a tight little dress Some back and forth conversation and he gives her an envelope Does not take long to figure out he is a pay to play type guy Lady gets in my car and has a very quite voice with a unique accent He is staying she is going with me he thanks me again She makes a phone call and I realize she is speaking Russian Next thing I know she is laying down in my back seat

Other guys phone rings and I arrange for him to be standing on the side of the road so I can just pull over and hand him the phone  minutes later I get to point he is standing there and I hand him the phone and he hands me  He looks at my PAX in the back seat gets a shocked look and then laughs I look back and her dress has rode up and her ass is just hanging out Yep you guessed it no panties She is sound a sleep

Here is a not so revealing picture after she rolled over and kind of fixed herself Ended up dropping her off outside Trump International Beach Resort where her Im guessing pimp was standing outside a Cadillac Escalade waiting for her

At a junction with a four way stop sign four cars arrive at their respective stop signs at the same time Who has the right of way

Nobody I replied

Incorrect replied the interviewer The correct answer is the driver to your right

Incorrect I replied If four cars arrive at the same time then each car is to the right of another driver meaning that all cars have right of way which in turn means that none of them does  none would have more right than any of the three drivers do

Thats what the California drivers handbook says said the interviewer

Then in this case the handbook is wrong I replied

When I arrive at the same time as another vehicle at a multiway stop sign

 If the other driver is in a BMW or Audi then the driver will believe she automatically goes first so I just let them

Pax Not always I walked to work this morning but I just feel too lazy to do it this afternoon so

Ive seen this beforelast weekend it was somewhat similarI picked up a couple on a lovely warm sunny afternoon they were grousing about having to wait more than an hour for their PU because of the driver shortage so I said Id shave a few mins off their rideonly to slide and see that the ride was only a min around the corner to the bar 

Both these ride were fine with mebecause this PUs were each only like  mins away from me and I was chasing down promos on them I knocked out these rides in under  mins totalbut aside from that it seems a waste during an Uber shortage to take lazy pax  blocks down the road to get a beer while others need to go to the airport etc and are getting a no car available responseIm wondering if Uber would hike minimum fares AND share it with drivers during this socalled driver shortage to better utilize drivers",-0.3673,0.118,0.775,0.106,Negative,0.21,0.05,0.24,0.24,0.26,2021,#1husler

"Had a pax who was just working now at a restaurant who decided that for himself it made no sense to go to college until he could get the full college experience He was such a friendly guy and we discussed how going to school now would not allow him any decent experiences He said that friends ahead of him in college have all remote learning and cannot attend classes or socialize like going to sports games clubs bars study halls So he said that he will postpone entering school until he can really have all the experiences he wanted 

I thought that was problably the best choice I told him that it was likely the right decision as college happens only once in your life and going now may not be the best decision especially because the cost of college is so great He told me that a freshman at U of Dayton pays year in tuition alone We agreed that for that massive of a sum it is worth it to wait",0.9669,0.041,0.818,0.14,Positive,0.08,0.03,0.28,0.11,0.5,2020,Young Kim

Pax tells me she is at the terminal I tell pax that I cannot pick up from the terminals Pax replies that she will go to a different terminal Cause if the driver says that he cant pick up from the terminals only from the designated pickup area it does of course make sense to suggest a different terminal to be picked up from Because who knows where the pickup area is Shoot me now

 Try to give pax stepbystep instructions on how to find the pickup area a Look for the signs b walk in direction indicated by signs c stop walking when pickup area is reached The moron is strong in this pax chance of success

"Howdy all you Ants On this episode of Id like to discuss the proper construction of your retirement portfolio Since UBER does not provide us with ks it is incumbent upon ourselves to construct a retirement plan that fits our needs Now I am not a certified financial planner no CFP designation but I am an expert in the fields of finance and investing  That said I can provide the board with my approach to investing which may work for some but everyone should do their own research and construct a plan that works for them and helps them achieve their goals all within the confines of their own personal risk appetite

Most importantly and regardless of how you choose to invest your savings an ant  save Various sources will advocate setting aside different percentages of your income in savings Taking that approach is fine but I save as much as humanly possible and likely well above the suggested percentages We  get in the mindset that money is not just a means of exchange it is an asset that can be deployed to earn its own return We  understand the wonders of compounding and how important it is to initiate this plan as early as possible in ones career IRAs can be a useful vehicle to start saving for many of us However some of us will not be able to utilize this structure if you and your old lady make more than k annually

Once the ant has decided to start saving and picked their desired vehicle they must decide how they wish to allocate their capital I am personally a fan of the endowment model popularized by David Swensen while at Yale The problem for most is that it takes a sizeable capital base to be able to deploy this strategy Fear not one can take a modified approach to attempt to match the returns and volatility profile of the endowment model  something FrankieT calls the modified endowment model

Public equities and bonds should be the cornerstone of every ants portfolio I personally use Vanguard ETFs to achieve the desired exposure for very low fees  fees are in this day and age an unnecessary drag on portfolio returns In this bucket beyond your traditional SP  type equities and treasuries or corporate bonds funds you may want to include ETFs that have exposure to emerging markets commodities REITS Collateralized Mortgage Backed Securities BDCs or other assets with solid yields However we must keep in my that dividends are taxed when distributed so this approach may not be the best for folks in high tax brackets Tax efficiencies are an often overlooked aspect of portfolio construction

I addition to these staples I like to add in more esoteric assets in order to mimic the endowment model Some of the easiest ways to get these exposures are to purchase a home which should increase in value rental properties cryptoassets which includes owning mining running masternodes and staking precious metals and music royalties I like to create a bucket for these alternative assets and then distribute this bucket into these other assets mentioned The goal of this approach is to diversify assets minimize correlations minimize volatility provide some passive income through yield and dividends and achieve returns in most market conditions Unfortunately most of us will not have access to LP investments in funds in private equity venture capital or hedge funds  however the right mix of investments can give you similar returns

I think this is a good start as a primer on retirement investing however I would like to open it up to the ants to suggest other favorite investments or investment strategies We are always interested in trying to achieve outsized returns and I believe the collective wisdom of the crowds is the best approach to trying to do so

Thank you and toodles

The first thing I realized is his hat that reads US Marine Out of curiosity I asked whether he was still actively serving may be a position of command intelligence or training the newly recruits etc By the time I entered the passcode he said he no longer served and was no different than any other citizen Then I thought we would part our ways after a simply reply with Oh I see When I was about to leave the same car was still parking by the garage gate with hazard lights on I then offered to open the garage gate beside the main gate such that he could wait inside the building He said That is sweet of you but I dont know which floor my  lives

Some of you guys really need an attitude check The passengers are not your enemy I wish some drivers would stop treating them as though they are It makes it hard for the rest of us

"Get a ping for a gated community on Saturday Right away send message asking for gate code I am now keeping a list No response from PAX I was only a minute away and am now at the gate I call the PAX and he answers I say Hi this is FL Keys from Uber Im at the gate and need a gate code He acts all stupid and says he has no idea what I am talking about he didnt order a ride and he is not sure he even has Uber on his phone I say is XXX your address and he says yes I say well someone used your phone to order a ride you need to go in the app and cancel it if you dont want it He barks back I dont have the app on my phone and he is going to end the call I hear a beep and think he ends the call I go to cancel and I hear in the back ground that he is yelling at someone for ordering a ride too soon

At that point I say screw it I need a break and gas anyway Ill leave the ride open and wait for him to cancel

I go get gas go to a fast food place and use the facility BS with the manager a few minutes fill my water cup and head out back on the road See the ride is still active on my phone Decide to drive by the place and a car is pulling out so I sneak through the gate I get close enough to the house to start the timer counting down Around the  minute mark I see another UberLyft car pull up to the house Pick the PAX up and head off 

Finally  minutes is up and I cancel for No Show I was surprised to see the no show fee come up as

"This time baby Ill be Bulletproof


I myself was assaulted by a young college student drunk girl I dropped her boyfriend off anf they were repeat customers of mine and they always got matched up with me when I was nearby All of a sudden as we were driving at night in the rich Edina homes area she grabs me from behind my seat and she isnt aware she is choking me and I cant even talk while at same time she pressed her face with smelly melted makeup hard against my cheek as she says I hope you get mad p tonight and i tried removing her arm off my adams apple as she was constricting my airflow and me blacking out means we will end up crashing into some million dollar home

The fight or flight adrenaline rush kicked in and I had to go SSJ with more blood flow to my muscles just to get her large arm off of me I thought to myself is this German genetics or were womem always this strong

I spared her of calling police on her as I didnt wanna ruin her future with a criminal record because she was drunk and didnt know she was endangering myself and herself and stuff outside the car in event of accident I warned her but with her drunkenness she didnt even listen to me 

In another incident an upscale looking man with golf shirt tucked in and looking like a father of your average college students When we got on the freeway he asks me if I am sending the drug dealers to assassinate him I offered to kick him out but he apologized so I dropped him off anyways He was maybe methhead

In another case in an upscale condo ping I picked up an Engineer who looked like a young Robert Redford and we had a couple stops  being the gas station and other being his girlfriend house

When we got to his girlfriend house and parked right in front of it on street where she can even see us if so she checked her large house windows I noticed the guy wasnt getting out then after a while he asks me Can I ask you something fill in my name here then I replied man it doesnt sound good if you have to ask me if its ok if you wanna ask me something

Then he says Can I suck your D quick Where D is you know what I then replied your girlfriend house is right there and can see us then he asks again and I reply can you just go to your girlfriend Then he asks again and I start opening my door and he gets scared and exists finally 

All these incidents are just with k rides I had There are tons of drivers with k rides Imagine what they have seen and experienced 

When I come back to Uber driving I will so get custom aftermarket bp glass shielding around my car seat separating me from front and rear sitting Pax No law against it Plus shootings happen in twin cities where I drove

Its a crazy workd out there You guy remember what that Walmart girl did to that Uber driver when she slashed him up to death

Back to that girl who choked me in the days following her assault I noticed increased fat burning and more muscle definition on myself and thought to myself I think the body thinks theres danger nearby always now that I survived that incident and body is favouring fitness now for survival lol",-0.9637,0.097,0.842,0.062,Negative,0.06,0.07,0.23,0.22,0.41,2021,ozzyoz7
"Last night I picked up a passenger from a Hospital Emergency Room entrance he was escorted out by a big burly sheriffs deputy and two hospital orderlies big men The passenger was behaving a bit odd from the start and I didnt feel good about taking him but I didnt feel like I could ask him to get out of the car at that point Big lesson learned
His destination was  miles away and he was bouncing off the sides of the vehicle the whole way throwing trash out the window sounding like he was gagging and possibly spitting I just held my breadth and told myself we would be at the destination and it would be over soon We got to the destination and he was laying down on the floor across the passenger and driver area and he would not get out of the car After nearly  minutes I had no choice but to call  He started spitting at things all over the car bringing up mucus and real nasty spit After  minutes of waiting he started to make like a tent in the back seat with his shirt and Id had enough I opened up the back door again and told him that was it he had to get out of my vehicle He lunged up between the seats into the front grabbed my bag of personal items and my cell phone and tried to get away I body slammed him back and he dropped the phone and bag He was pushed back into the car in that exchange and I put my head in and convinced him if he didnt get out it would be bad for him He opened the passenger side door got out and walked away As soon as he was no longer in site the Sheriff deputy showed up I told the deputy what happened and the direction the guy left in The glass back of my Samsung S was shattered the deputy asked if I wanted to file a report on it and I said no not right then Maybe later I reached out to Uber and escalated the situation to a supervisor They are glad Im not hurt wont do anything about the spit no pictures I wiped the nastiness up with a towell and offered me  for my destroyed phone I sent pictures of the phone along with the receipt I buy phones outright it was  I cant press charges because I cant get the passengers information I can only imagine one of my adult daughters being put in this situation

"Just had a pax who told me the most painful reason I heard that he had to start taking an Uber A rather young guy in his mid s coming from a friends house He told me that he lost his car and license in Illinois because of unpaid Illinois Tollway fines When I asked him how much he owed his answer shocked me The pax said he owed over  I thought he meant  But he said he just kept on ignoring the fines until the fines multipliedall the while running even more tolls and having them multiply I am not sure how the fines multiply but I am guessing it was not a simple doubling like overdue parking tickets He did say that he was optimistic that he could under the new Illinois law regarding tollway fines to have them significantly reduced under some pandemic assistance relief program

I found it fascinating because as I wrote there seems to be a definite trend how many young people are seeking to build a career in the world of social media They are shunning traditional careers and trying hard to carve their own path Many guys are trying to sell merchandise online and produce music Many young ladies are trying to make it in the world of fashion and cooking She says she is actively advertising her Instagram account and trying to build up a large following A whole bunch of them are doing loads and loads of TikTok videos Here are a few of her pics I can certainly tell from the efforts she has been putting into her pictures and her many many posts that she is dead serious

I got my phone out took the pictures and then sent them in to Uber with the damage report I then got the gloves and paper towels out and blotted and dried the stain as much as possible A few hours later the stain had almost gone just leaving a faint outline ring At the end of the night I did the usual routine of Lysol and water cleaning of the seat have to clean the entire seat base to not leave water stains It took about  minutes to clean

Anyway I though that Uber would give me  bucks The next morning they emailed me to tell me that they had charged the pax  In contrast to Ubers lowball cleaning fees of late I recently got just  bucks for puke on the car  was too much for this stain

I turn to the door to hopefully grab the staff they vanished into thin air Called from the app went to the patient 

Apologized to him profusely and escorted him to a bench in front of the door I tried to explain that he would need to tell the hospital that he needed another car and to let the driver know in advance that it was an extremely long trip He did not seem to understand that but did understand why I had to cancel 

Medical staff and patients often seems to think that all we do is medical transport if we pick up at a hospital or clinic They do not understand that were Joe Regular Uber Driver

And there you have it Uber and Lyft could not have predicted the rise in fooddelivery services and the need for them during this pandemic which will continue Bottom Line Food delivery drivers make more money with less miles driven They stay local and dont go on any long trips like I did today  trips over to Alabama with a deadhead back because I cannot take Uber  Lyft trips trips in Alabama

So I listened to him all night and as I mentioned once you get to the west or south side of Chicago you dont often leave the area This is because many drivers will avoid the area or log off once they drop off there Therefore if you get to the area and leave on the app you will stay there all night Many pax who came in were so excited and happy that an Asian would enjoy hip hop rap RB and congratulated me on my musical tastes

I spoke to pax all night regarding DMX his turbulent life and his very depressing death One young lady pax I spoke to said that DMX reminded her of her family a great deal a very high functioning drug user She talked about how her father uses PCP casually and does a good job to help the community and other people She said that drug users should not be stereotyped as criminals The young lady emphasized that once you demonize drugs and make it illegal it glamorizes it and makes rebellious young people get into it more and more

Pax talked about how music unifies and brings the world together and DMX the rapper made incredible music One pax kept using the word GOAT as an acronym to describe DMX GGreatest OOf AAll TTime It was amazing to see the impact that the death of a legendary rapper had on a community like Chicago After my shift I watched some of DMXs acting jobs with Jet Li like in CradleGrave and Romeo Must Die He was a very talented person

"Picked up a young lady pax south of downtown Chicago around  am and heard her talking to a guy in a hushed voice on the phone So you got what I need because I got the money She talked price on the phone and then hung up We then started talking and she said she was going deeper into the south side of Chicago to complete a deal She clutched her large purse and counted cash I thought for sure it was something else but I found out that she had human hair wigs in her purse

She said this when I asked her how she is managing the pandemic with all the uncertainty in employment for everyone This is one of my standard pax questions She said like many young pax that she was selfemployed and bought and sold hair weaves and wigs She explained that all her products come straight from Asia She said It comes from your countries China Korea and India 

She said that the best hair and prices come from the East She buys them from a secret source and then resells them This is why she feels the need to hide them from law enforcement Human hair wigs are not by themselves illegal but she felt that if law enforcement somehow discovered the source she could get into trouble sort of like having cartons of cigarettes which escaped duty US Customs tax

When I asked her if I could see one she looked behind us and around first said Well I dont see any police so here is one She showed me a few and some were weaves and some were wigs which one was dyed blond and brown They looked very nice and high quality to me The pax described her business which was booming

She said that there are smugglers of vast amounts of human hair which are often obtained illegally She said that in some Asian countries ladies have their long hair cropped off against their will sometimes in cases of religious sacrifice like when a holy leader will tell the lady that to show her love and devotion to a god then she must demonstrate a sacrificelike her long hair Which the religious leader will then sell 

I didnt really know this illegal but I guess the young lady knew that she cannot be in possession of large quantities of it This puzzled me because I know many wigs are made with real human hair and I had no idea this would be illegal She really acted like she had bags of illicit substances in her purse which was my first guess I am guessing that while a person can have maybe one of two wigs for personal use if someone has many many such hair pieces then it may not be permitted if it was determined that such products were smuggled into the US 

I suppose I found this pax ride interesting because she told me that up to  of young ladies on the south and west sides of Chicago have wigs and hair extensions I thought that young ladies just straighten their hair and then carefully take hours to weave them or braid them by hand But my pax explained that almost always you are looking at a wig not their natural hair 

Then she surprised me by pulling up her own beautiful weave to reveal a nearly bald shaved head She said her ethnicitys hair frizzes so easily especially in moisture so it is far easier to have very very short hair and then just put on a wig  weave The pax explained that she makes a very good living buying creating styling human hair from the Asian countries and there is a massive never ending market at least here in Chicago",0.997,0.033,0.836,0.13,Positive,0.06,0.02,0.46,0.12,0.33,2021,Young Kim
"Driving through this pandemic this past year Ive had multiple customers complain that they could not get a Lyft ride Since  year ago as month after month passed pax would often tell me that they tried to get a Lyft first because it was cheaper but the wait times got longer and longer

Some of them were hardcore Lyft loyalists but they have been telling me that around the new year it got really bad with wait times being over  minutes at least in Chicago But recently they said they could not even get one at all It would say Lyfts are unavailable in your area Or something like that

A couple of customers last night told me that they are worried because they think that once Uber finishes off Lyft theyre going to jack up the fares even more because then Uber will be a complete total monopoly and they can set the prices wherever they want Many Uber ants have both apps up

"As if I needed a reason to make this a personal practice another rd party ride disaster happened last night 

Just before pickup text from pax you will be picking up Anton a friend of mine He is going to the hospital his sister just died

Ok

Anton I assumed was a disheveled black male of indeterminate age as I pulled up to the house he was attempting to park a bicycle on its kickstand Ok I waited until he finally gave up and leaned the bike against the house 

UBER

Yeah Hop in

Anton approaches with no mask and a bag of chips 

You need a mask and no eating in the car 

No problem

Puts on mask rolls chips up into a ball and gets in Off we go 

We need to stop at a church Im from Charlottesville Ill show you where to go

Realizing that he didnt order the ride asking him to put in a stop is pointless so I ask which church Its on the way no biggie Then he starts giving me directions loudly leaning forward towards the front mask drooping below his chin I realize he is very intoxicated The directions turn into excited shouts TURN HERE NO THERE LISTEN TO ME

We stop at the church I turn and say you will not shout at me and you will wear your mask if you want a ride He gets out leaves the door open and goes to the church door where there are several packages All the while shouting obscenities at someone on his phone This all happened in the space of a minute or less I look in the back seat chips and crumbs everywhere Fuck this I jump out close the door toss his chips on the street End trip drive away I hear him bellowing curses for two blocks One star call support to document

"I drove up to a strip club in Stone Park IL called The Gold Room all purple lights outside and picked up two guys and drove them into downtown Chicago this past Saturday night around  am They came in mildly drunk but were incredibly happy I remarked to them that I was surprised the strip clubs were open again because I had heard they had closed due to covid The guy behind me told me No man they reopened I was so excited that I slapped each of the girls in the as tonight thanking each of them for getting back to work

On the way to downtown one of the guys became very chatty and started talking a LOT about aliens and how he feels that they either created this world as a D simulation and we are all living in a video gameor they are behind the scenes controlling it completely by assuming key behind the scenes roles He went so far as to suggest that there are large underground military bases where the world leaders are collaborating with some alien races who wish to study humans 

I could tell that he had studied a lot into this area and he mentioned a lot of details about stories he read about famous UFOalien sightings Once in a while his friend would chime in and say that aliens must exist as there are endless worlds and universes out there He then discussed how we are all sort of living in a human ant farm like environment where everything is controlled and all variables altered to see how humans would react

When he asked me my opinion on all this I replied I can agree that there very well could be aliens but until they show up and affect my life directly I am not interested I told them that it is cool to ponder but since I cannot prove or disprove their existence right now it is not practical for me to think about it After he asked me if I had seen any I told him no He said he did see some before looking at the night sky with a telescope and he saw some when he experimented with DMT a powerful psychedelic drug 

The ride ended though in sort of a funny way About  minutes from our destination the more quiet guy sitting on my passenger side rear suddenly ask me to drive faster because he had to go to the bathroom ASAP I told him that I cannot risk getting a ticket but if it is an emergency I can pull over He said fine and then he would be OK Then with about  seconds left he screamed at me Pull over pull over now right NOW 

So I stopped quickly and he got out and then his friend who was talking about all the alien stuff went out and both relieved themselves for a long while by a building wall After they both got back in and the guy on the right said Dude that was such a relief thanks a bunch I am gonna tip you  on the app ok Anyways the ride ended and I was left entertained by those two",0.9951,0.034,0.838,0.128,Positive,0.09,0.05,0.14,0.26,0.46,2021,Young Kim

"My first pax of this Sunday night was a guy I drove from Glenview IL to downtown Chicago He previously worked in the advertising business but was laid off due to covid Now he just started trying to make a living rehabbing houses and flipping them On the long ride  minutes we talked about a lot of things but mostly he complained about Uber and Lyft these days He said that he and his friends were die hard rideshare loyalists but recently he started souring on both companies

For example he said that tonight Easter Sunday he could not get a Lyft or an Uber for over an hour until I accepted the ride I drove  minutes to pick him up Before I accepted the ride he said that both Uber and Lyft told him some message like No drivers in your area try again soon or Are you sure you wish to request limited available carssomething like that He was so grateful that I finally picked him up because he was just about to give up He told me If you hadnt come then I would have had to stay overnight with my exwife so thank from the bottom of my heart for that 

He mentioned the ridiculous surge Lately he said the prices for both Uber and Lyft were equal or sometimes a lot more than what a taxi used to be And there were no more quick pickup times  minutes or less that he was used to for rideshare Now just like the taxi industry before he would often wait up to an hour as he was in the suburbs for an Uber or Lyft to showor none availablejust like the taxis

Therefore he voiced active hope that the taxi industry would get themselves back together to shape and make a valiant comeback We discussed how the Chicago medallions were a high of  back in  Now there is no bid no buyers So he hoped that now that the prices are so incredibly low there could be a chance for the left for dead taxicab companies to make a comebackand wished eagerly for them to make an effort

This got me thinking

I was actually far happier for a multitude of reasons driving a taxi part time I drove for Flash Cab and other companies than driving rideshare for two very evil companies I felt I had very more control over my destiny driving a cab Plus I paid zero attention to whether my car would depreciate not have to worry that I could be deactivated for a nonsense complaint etc etc etc etc etc

I turn the Lyft app on first because its less fussy than the stupid Uber app Take a picture of yourself Then Now take a picture with your mask on And then Now give us a urine sample It never ends Before I can even get Uber up and running the Lyft app is sending me a trip From that point on its gogogo stacked pings all day for as long as I want to drive Yes some of them are for faraway pickups and I decline as many of them as I can Many days I dont even logon to Uber

Another student I picked up yesterday was a rdyear student from a city college who also was feeling that he can make a lot more money doing things on his own than what he is learning at school He felt that being an entrepreneur is far better than trying to work for a corporation in the future He told me last night that he bought three used cars at auction last night and he will fix them up and resell them He was super excited and he talked all about how much profit hed be making

There was a third guy that just graduated from New Trier high School which is a highly regarded school where a lot of rich kids go to That ride was about two nights ago and I remember he lived in Winnetka Illinois which is a very affluent suburb He was making a lot of money buying premium sneakers from online and in the north side and then he would drive to the south and the west side and sell them to inner city teenagers He described that he could buy the sneakers himself for about  and turn around some of them to some of the teenagers the inner city for  He felt that he could make it his full time job after he finishes high school in a couple of months He showed me his Instagram account where he showed off all of his shoes in his inventory

"There are a two points of view regarding postyourboast earnings threads in which people post their earnings in various levels of detail posting summaries only providing full breakdowns of individual trips or anything and everything in between Some people say that posting earnings guides to ones own market is foolish Others judging by the number of them on here think that they are great My own opinion is that they certainly are foolish However they have also benefitted me which seems contradictory Here is my experience

Late last year I was browsing this forum when I noticed a postyourboast thread Its HOPPING in my town posted the OP who went on to describe in detail the goingson in his local market He had posted a screenshot of the driver app screen of his latest weekly earnings broken down by day and also screenshots of several individual rides showing the spots that the rides originated along with the day date time and value of each one

This is interesting I thought The area advertised by the earnings boaster is a smallish community around  miles outside a major metro area in California which I knew vaguely I have friends who live very close to it whom I hadnt seen in a while plus things had been very slow in the Bay Area I had also felt like taking a little vacation So I decided to go and visit and combine a vacation with a chance to make some good money I had never driven rideshare there but my plan was simple I would just go to the spots identified by the OP on the days and times advertised by him turn on the driver app and wait

And so it happened One road trip later I went to the first staging area turned the app on and waited Things turned out to be just as the OP had said Demand was excellent and I soon bagged some great highdollar rides and a couple of very high dollar rides Over the next week I was very pleased with the results Interestingly during this time I picked up the same passenger three times from her house was a couple of miles from where I was staying indicating that there were few drivers in the area This coupled with the nice surges and excellent ping quantity was evidence of a very favourable demanddriver ratio in the area

Now back to the question posed above regarding whether postyourboast is a good idea for both the poster and for me Lets find the answer with simple costbenefit analyses If the benefits outweigh the costs then well say that it was a good result and if benefits do not outweigh the costs well say that it was not a good result

For me the costs of the exercise were gas to get to and from the posters location and the earnings I did not make in the Bay Area The benefits were the earnings I made in his area which exceeded the gas cost and my foregone home earnings by a country mile So for me it was a good result

For the OP its hard to estimate the costs of me working his area When I accepted the pings there I obviously denied those rides to all other drivers in the area Was the driver one of those drivers Was he working the area on the days and times I was Theres no way to tell All we know is that it was possible Its also possible that I was not the only driver attracted into his area by his advertising Now lets look at the other side of the analysis  the benefit side to him of advertising his area This can be summed up as zero In dollar terms  Nada As we said above if the benefits outweigh the costs then it is a positive result However with a benefit of zero the benefits of advertising ones own area on a public forum can never by defintion outweigh the cost The cost being of course the risk of losing business to competitors that one attracted into the area

In summary advertising ones area in postyourboast threads is foolish but the magnitude of the foolishness depends on the level of detail given At the top of the tree we have posting exact hotspots together with the days of the week and times to get good rides there This will result in immediate competition from other drivers turning up Further down the list of selfscuppering is the posting of daily earnings totals and the general location of the earnings While one does not divulge the exact locations and times of the opportunities it is still persuasive in attracting drivers both old and new into ones area With zero benefit for the poster boaster it is hard to see how this is a good idea As seen above there is no benefit to it for the advertiser However for the driver looking for new opportunities and areas to drive in or for existing drivers who have taken a break and are considering returning to rideshare in their town these posts can be golden eggs

Conclusion  keep posting them please Just dont do it in my area thumbup",0.9987,0.035,0.82,0.145,Positive,0.21,0.02,0.27,0.15,0.34,2021,The Gift of Fish

after he told me that he had shot somebody and gone to jail and told me to look up his name on Google I did so quickly at the next traffic light and indeed it was my passenger and I saw his mugshot He then told me about how he had been to a couple of state prisons and told me about the life inside prison Somehow he got out after several years

He befriended some people with the cartel while inside prison when he was in jail After leaving jail he said he started to work for them When I asked him why he did that because I told him it was so dangerous he said that the money is so good Also he told me that the women are so plentiful that he has no problem finding beautiful young women all the time He showed me on his phone at a couple of lights where we were stopped him posing with many beautiful women and him describing that he had been with all of them

I think he could sense that I didnt quite believe his story at first and the reason that I was a little skeptical was honestly I thought to myself that if someone is actively killing somebody why would they tell some total random stranger

Then he said I could sense that you doubt me so let me show you look And then when I turned around he produced what he said was a loaded handgun I did get scared at first but then I calmed down and then just asked him to put it away He kept on asking me if I was wearing a wire He also kept asking me if I wanted to take a bump of cocaine in the car Naturally I said no to both I told him that I would never use drugs under any circumstance and especially never while I was driving Uber

I thought if I should try to get help while I was in the ride I figured it would not be a good idea to antagonize somebody in the situation that I was in I quickly looked at the name on my app and it was not the name of my passenger So I thought to myself if something were to happen then there wouldnt be any way to necessarily track him

So I just stayed calm and listened to him tell stories of people that hes killed They were both targets in Mexico and the US He said he particularly asks for pedophiles and women beaters Tell me about the fees that he collects and theyre usually between three and  in the US The most he got was  He described that there was a code of course of no women no children however there were some unusual circumstances where things like that were allowed

then he went into some graphic detail and asked me if I ever saw somebodys head getting cut off I remember him also asking me if I ever saw several ks of cocaine live right in front of me Then he told me about the time that he saw somebody get drawn and quartered by five different cars Like they would tie each limb and the head to five different cars and then drive in different directions It went into more graphic detail about people being boiled alive and many other things I wont go into

it almost seemed like he was telling me his autobiography because he told me about names locations places hes done hitsI was extremely utterly surprised that he would go into such detail with somebody he did not know

Anyway the ride ended and like I said I stayed very very calm and collected and I didnt report it to Uber or anything else In fact he told me that the name on the account was just someone untraceable so I wouldnt even need to bother Besides he told me that I could tell someone his story but I couldnt use any personal details and I did not here He did very calmly tell me it would be a shame that someone so cool and smart like me would suddenly disappear

I wanted to share the story because it was highly unusual and it was probably the very first time while driving a passenger that I felt a little tingle of fear I did not embellish or exaggerate even a single detail of the story here

"So Im gonna pull a Young Kim at the risk of owing him royalties and talk about a random act of kindness that yours truly shared with a pax

So this week I picked up a pax who just clocked off a  hour shift and was going to his girlfriends placehe asked me if I wouldnt mind going to the drive thru liquor store so he could bring over a pack 

These are the kinds of overtures I ALWAYS turn down because it opens up a portal of time wastage and dramaI was about to say no sorry but then glanced through my mirror at this guy who had gotten off his shift and just wanted to relax with his woman and beer and I thoughtI can do it just this one 

We stop at the drive thru liquor store he orders his pack but cant find his ID and the cashier wont make an exception for him hes really frustrated and tells me hey lets just get outta here so I put the car in drive but then again look at through the mirror at him pause put the car in park call the cashier back and say Im ordering what he just ordered

The pax passed a  up to the front seat I pay and try give him the pack and this change and says no mann just keep it

I dropped the pax offdrove off and realized I had unwittingly performed a random act of kindness toward a pax",-0.2592,0.066,0.881,0.054,Negative,0.04,0.04,0.26,0.3,0.37,2021,#1husler
"My last pax of the night I found particularly interesting because her story was unique She had found a sugar daddy I picked her up around the Edison Park Illinois area and brought her to the DoubleTree hotel in downtown Chicago We got to talking and I asked her how the pandemic has affected her

She told me that it was pretty rough when the pandemic started because she had been working at McCormick place as one of those young women who are hired to promote displays its a business convention center and frequently they hire young ladies to cater to the businessmen who are coming in and show off whatever company theyre representing

During one of the conventions an older gentleman had befriended her and they exchanged phone numbers somehow After some communication they didnt talk for a little while Once the pandemic struck she lost all of her gigs at the convention center some of which paid her upwards of  per hour to basically stand there

Is she contacted the older gentleman and they made an agreement He would come into town and pay her visit in a hotel and they would I guess be companions for the short time he was in Chicago She actually has a young son that she must take care of so meeting him and him agreeing to be her supporter was quite fortunate for her

I asked gently her if she enjoyed his company and the entire arrangement and she seemed just okay with it Like she didnt say that she really loved him or that she hated him or anything like that For her it was just kind of a business arrangement to help her support herself and her young son Of course she didnt tell me the amount and obviously I didnt ask but she said that he sends her money every month

I thought this was interesting because during this pandemic people must cope in all sorts of different ways She was actually the first person I met who actually had a real sugar daddy she did tell me that he was happily married with children But that did not bother her because of course thats not what she wanted because he was probably around  years old I couldnt be sure but he actually came out to greet her cuz he was so excited so I got to briefly see him",0.9869,0.026,0.856,0.118,Positive,0.15,0.02,0.26,0.26,0.31,2021,Young Kim

"While I have no idea how the glorious days were like when these RS companies first emerged there is no question that the rates are paltry these days With the combination of multiple rate cuts deteriorating passengers and the pandemic I have decided to quit once and for all

Recently I have been obsessed with deliveries most of which are grocery shopping At first it sounds ridiculous to me to be paid Uber rate to not only transport cargoes but also include the shopping component Contrary to my expectation this is very addicting Dont be mistaken I am not saying grocery shopping gigs are better than Ubering in any part Although the base pay is about  consider the amount of time needed to complete one delivery this is certainly not worth the effort without any incentives What I mean by incentives are in nature not the useless badges and ratings

First I love the upfront information about expected pay time to completion and pickup and dropoff locations all of which we are supposed to be entitled to not to be provided only if certain outrageous criteria are met Here comes the best part the monetary incentives Depending on the local markets and time the estimated payout with bonus included can be far more attractive than doing rides not to mention you will have full control of where to end up after a delivery Needless to say how much we take home is also highly dependent on the willingness of customers to tip However if you are the type that withdraw every penny after each delivery this may not work for you because there is a  cap Personally I have no problem for these companies to keep the money for a year if there is a minimum of  interest rate 




Finally I am also astonished by the real time support For instance a transaction will be denied by default when customers request additional items after we accept an order It only takes a minute or two for the support to override the payment authorization They are also very helpful to assign a return for unsuccessful deliveries Since not every store accepts return because of the pandemic basically I have free food plus the  to drive back to the store The only time that happened to me also include some adult products Um may be I should consider selling them",0.991,0.088,0.754,0.158,Positive,0.15,0.04,0.25,0.13,0.43,2021,MyJessicaLS430

I was stunned at his answer He told me his house cost him only about  before closing costs last year He said there was a slightly renovated one that was a few houses down that was  I was kind of in disbelief because his subdivision was not dilapidated or run down at all

granted this was the night so I couldnt get a good look but there did not seem to be any trash or any boardedup houses or lawns that seemed not wellmaintained It just looked like any other subdivision that you might find in Chicagoland When I finished the ride I remember I went on redfin and verified that houses in his subdivision really were only about  to  in that area

I just was so stunned that houses could be so cheap this is before the pandemic but I remember I went on craigslist and I saw a parking space in river north Chicago which is in downtown Chicago selling for  And that was just a parking space To be able to purchase a home for between  to  it just seems so incredible

"I had a good FridaySaturday evening last weekend and I was at home catching up on a book with the TV on when I got a ping for a long ride My longest ride by far at  miles Before this request my longest ride was about  miles I had been sitting at x starting around PM and did take a quick ride around PM for  but then Uber signed me out and forced me to take a selfie which I did When I signed back in I forgot to change my fare multiplier so if I was at x who knows if I would have even got the  mile ride There were other ants available so I was surprised it came in at x I guess the other ants didnt want the ride

Anyway I saw the amount and did a quick screen shot then accepted the ride thinking it was a high surge ride to Santa Barbara in the  range It wouldnt be my first  ride to Santa Barbara so I was OK with the blind accept I then looked at the screen shot and saw it was to LA Oh man do I want to do this at PM on a Sunday

So I go to The Boss who is prepping her lesson plan and for the next two minutes or so we talk about the ride

I have a juicy  or more ride Gotta go

LA Are you serious
mumbling yes
You are going to LA at this time You wont be back for hours
Its gonna be like  an hour so why not
CUZ ITS LA
Should I cancel
Its up to you thats a long ride You are just watching TV so go be safe

After that nod of approval I did a quick bathroom break grabbed a Rockstar and took off at PM The pick up was near me in a newer part of town and a fatheruncleloverpimp with his daughternieceloverhooker was waiting for me Just the lady got in my car and didnt speak one word of English I confirmed the address with the guy and off we went The lady fell asleep within  minutes and was slumped over in the back seat for about an hour and then just kept to herself in the backseat it was like nobody was even there

The ride was noneventful until about  minutes from our destination She took a speakerphone call in Chinese and then out the blue she just put her phone right up to my face I could not see anything but the blue screen in my right eye She said talk and the person on the phone was saying Hello I took the phone said hello and the person just wanted to confirm the dropoff I said thats the place and that was that

I did miss a turn in LA it was dark and there was a lot of traffic so I had to do a UTurn at a light and a guy waiting for her at a Chinese restaurant when we arrived at PM Both said thanks and off they went Uber paid over  and they gave a  tip Not bad for the first  hours

I was getting ping after ping for local rides anywhere from  outrageous who the hell drives for  up to  but I didnt know the locations and I didnt want to go out of my way so I turned on the trip filter and I was still getting a lot of pings I did see one x for  to  from Union Station to Studio City about  miles and took that I got another ride at x for   plus  cash tip from the Warner Center in Woodland Hills up to Calabasas that was not much out of the way at all I got sporadic pings for the last  miles home that I ignored

I get home at AM  hours and  minutes total for the  rides and one bathroom stop in Ventura  miles and just a little over  for doing the entire trip I used about a half tank of gas I started with a little over  and ended with a little less than a

She works currently for Comcast and is a technical support agent She said that when the pandemic struck last year they offered everyone who worked a  bonus in their hourly salary Then because of the pandemic she was promoted finally to being a manager with a big salary raise in addition to the  bump

Then all the sudden she said she felt like she hit the jackpot because Comcast said that everyone could work remotely She said that was such a relief because she said that initially her office was in Schaumburg then they moved her to oakbrook and then finally to Bolingbrook Illinois Her commute times went from  minutes to  minutes to  hour when she finally got located to Bolingbrook Illinois The commute was killing her because sometimes when there was traffic it would be an hour and a half back home

she loved being able to just work from her pajamas because she doesnt even have to be seen since shes a technical support agent Then recently she said that they introduced at Comcast a text support feature that means she doesnt even have to be on the phone anymore with a headset She said that was a godsend because she was sick and tired of having to continue to talk to customers who would ramble on and on She didnt have to talk over them anymore 

She said she could also listen to music which she said was a first while she was working She would just blast music and then shed be on video with friends just hanging out Sometimes she would just go to friends homes and even restaurants and just do her work from there

She also said that she had just recently bought a brand new car because her old one broke down But because of the pandemic she said that she was able to sell her car to her friend who gave her a very good price so now she no longer has a car payment or has to pay for any insurance and just takes Uber when she needs to go somewhere but she says its not often

She said with all the promotions in the bump up and pay and the incredibly relaxing work and being able to sell her car that her finances completely turned around She told me that shes saving up so much money for extended vacations to Italy and France and all around the world she said she could never save money before the pandemic She just yesterday got her third stimulus bonus by direct deposit as well

She admitted that she feels terrible about this because shes knows a lot of people have gotten sick and died and she feels guilty about admitting to anybody how she feels but she admitted to me that shes had a hard life and after years and years of difficult times the universe finally rewarded her personally with the pandemic She said her life was now better than ever Better than its ever been in her entire life Ive had a lot of pandemic stories that were somewhat positive in the last year but this one blew all the others out of the water",0.9588,0.065,0.833,0.101,Positive,0.07,0.02,0.38,0.16,0.36,2021,Young Kim

"One of my riders last night was a pickup from downtown Chicago going to a Northwest suburb last night His name was Augustus Nice conversation to start I talked about sports Cubs and Blackhawks and then the weather There was rain last night in Chicago

Then he suddenly asked me a question from out of the blue What did you think about what happened during the elections My interior caution light went off of immediately So I proceeded with caution

I told him Im not sure what happened but I know a lot of people thought there was some suspicious activity in the election

Augustus thank goodness I found someone else who agrees with me and half the country

Me well I really cant comment too much because I dont know enough about the matter but what I read on various news outlets was that there was really irregular voting activity

Augustus I looked out myself personally in Wisconsin and saw that there were more votes for the senators in the state than for the president Who would go to a voting booth and not vote for the president Also how could biden have gotten more votes than Obama Why was there reports of hours passing in certain voting booths with  of the votes going for Biden and none for Trump There was massive massive voting mail in ballot fraud

Me not sure I can see why many people would consider that

Augustus You know its really hard being a Republican in Chicago right

Me Yes indeed if you wore a red maga hat in downtown Chicago I think people would start hitting you

Augustushe went on and on and on about how the Democratic policies were just destroying the country He brought up how he thinks Kamala Harris is certainly going to become president if not Nancy pelosi He told me that if Biden cannot serve  years then Nancy pelosi automatically according to the law becomes the president Im not sure myself He talked about how President Biden when he reads a teleprompter once he read the closed captioning brackets that introduced the next event He said Biden was completely utterly demented who is a puppet who is hiding in the basement He continued saying Trump will prevail again in  A lot of lies he said were spoken about the Democrats about the lethality of the virus It went on and on and on and on

Me I just kept silent trying to keep my integrity by not totally agreeing with the stuff about Trumps absolute greatness vaccine data masks etc BUT at the same time not arguing with Augustus I stayed pleasant calm and polite throughout the entire interaction and ride And listened with intention

At the end of the ride I found a  tip on my app

"Uber recently lost its challenge in the UK courts to have its drivers classified as independent contractors In a nutshell the UK Supreme Court judged Ubers claims that it is merely a software platform that links pax and drivers to be nonsense and that its drivers are indeed employees Ubers reaction to making its UK drivers employees



And



So in the UK Dara and Co accept that the UK ruling that its drivers are employees is a clearer path forward in giving its workers rights and that it is willing to change its ways

However in California the company sings along to a completely different tune Voters decided in the Prop  election that Ubers drivers are not employees but independent contractors Ubers reaction



And



In California Uber praises voters for deciding the polar opposite of the UK and that decision to  class its drivers as employees is the best for the drivers

Doublespeak much We as drivers have known for a long time that Uber has its bullshit generator running  However up until now the bullshit had largely been consistent Now Uber demonstrates that it will say whatever it thinks will benefit it the most adapting the rhetoric at will to whatever situation it finds itself in regardless of any contradictions with previously published positions

Such duplicity would worry me greatly as an investor particularly with reference to Daras claims surrounding promised future profitability However with Ubers stock price still on an upward trend none of this seems to worry the market Go figure

"It seems ok but just another way for customers to cheap out We dont need cheaper services with need higher quality services that pay  of the fee to the driver always I think a minimum fee of something would work even if it was only a few blocks It would help filter out bad customers kinda Not always though of course

Anyway the service is where you use the customers car to drive Not exactly sure how it works but it seems ok At least your not putting wear and tear on your own car Though I see disadvantages of this for the driver somewhat What do you all think  Good service idea by whoever created it It is like  or  a hour depending on where you live Seems like not enough for the driver

"This evening I picked up a passenger in Detroit They werent at the pick up location I figured out that they were around the corner and down the street When I got there they immediately started calling me names after getting in the car Soon they began calling me gay ed ugly ass and using the N word repeatedly 

I asked them to stop swearing and to just confirm their drop off since the pick up was incorrect and name They continued to call me names and swear yelling at me Eventually I called Lyfts emergency ride number The ADT rep was wonderful After hearing a few seconds of this including the threats to F up my gay  ass they recommended calling the police or immediately ending the ride I explained that the passenger was four minutes away and there was no easy way to get them out of the car They said they would stay with me out of a concern for my safety 

They continued to yell similar racial and other hateful comments as I drove no one will ever suck your Dxxx you ugly gay  I remained silent and got them to their destination Fortunately they got out while still threating to kill me 

The ADT safety rep was wonderful She was kind and recognized that I was in shock She offered assistance and stayed with me until I could breathe again 

Lyft They sent me an email asking me to call them When I did they said they were too busy and to send them an email 

Oh and while I was on the phone with ADT emergency support they assigned me a new pick up Im a  star drive so I pulled it together and drove there The passenger didnt show up After waiting ten minutes and calling and texting six times I cancelled I received a message that I needed to drive close even though I was a foot from the front door Im still trying to get my cancellation fee Fortunately I took a phot of me right under the address and at the front door 

Meanwhile there is a disturbed passenger out there willing to make multiple threats to kill a Lyft driver  and Lyft could care less

"I picked up a pax in Chicago and as we talked he said to me You seem like a very knowledgeable guy could you please give me advice on what to do with my girlfriend We are having issues His real name I remember was Lorenzo I dont see an issue with saying his real name because he did not disclose anything illicit or extremely personalit is just sort of an innocent story I replied OK Ill try to do my best He said Well my girlfriend said we should try to stop something we are doing and be more responsible I wondered if it was something bad like drugs or gambling or overspending 

He went on to say that his girlfriend is starting to feel guilty about how they are sexually active Lorenzo said that he wanted to get married to her soon and she expressed that she felt the same about him The issue was that she felt if they are planning to get married she should not be sexually active prior to marriage She said that there was a thing about revirginizing oneself He said he was frustrated that he would have to wait for sexual fulfillment He said he was  years old and his girlfriend was  

At least to me he was very gentle sort of shy and the sort of person that could not hurt a fly I remarked to him about this how gentle and kind he seemed and he said that has always been his personality I asked him about his girlfriend advising him not to get too personal and he said his girlfriend was the same I then asked if religion had anything to do with his girlfriend wanting to revirginize herself I pondered if she was Muslim where premarital sex is particularly frowned upon 

He told him that both he and his girlfriend were Christian I then asked him Do you want to marry her then Do you see a forever long term relationship with her Without hesitation he said that he does and that there is no other for him So then I advised him Well then bro the answer is obvious get married right away dont wait If you know she is the one and she is going to withhold sex from you now then just get married immediately

He replied that the issue was his family was very very large and that both of them talked about it and how having a wedding during this pandemic would be exceedingly difficult So they felt they needed to wait

I then suggested a solution that he got really happy to hear I told him that a few of my younger cousins secretly got married this year just in court without telling anyone in the family They did so for many reasons and they did not want to say just invite a few people in the family and have others feel left out But they immediately told everyone in the family through a group email that they plan to have the BIG family wedding AFTER the pandemic restrictions lift and then everyone will feel included

This solution seemed to surprise Lorenzo and he said Omg why didnt I think of that before He thanked me profusely and seemed incredibly happy Then he said that he would propose the idea to his girlfriend right away After he left I could tell that at least he was sincere because he left a  tip on a rather short ride Sometimes we ants have to play therapist In this case I found a solution that the pax really appreciated 

Question for my fellow antshave you also had a situation where you found a keen solution to a relationship issue that the pax latched onto

The next day I asked some female friends that I have if revirginizing is a thing before marriageand I found that many of them agreed with Lorenzos girlfriend that many women do this to buttress their feelings of innocence and integrity as a lady I suppose that I learn every day I heard of this but I really did not know how prevalent such a thing really was",0.9839,0.021,0.887,0.091,Positive,0.08,0.05,0.35,0.21,0.31,2021,Young Kim
"This was a firstnot just one but two of my pax fell flat onto the pavement as they exited my Uber I picked up around  am three pax at a bar called Drink in Schaumburg IL as the bar was closing All three got into my car just fine so I accepted them into my car I of course would have thought of cancelling if they stumbled towards my car but all three walked just fine

But after they got into the car I knew at least two were completely smash drunk The girlfriend of one of the pax slumped over onto her boyfriends shoulder almost immediately and passed out Jose the pax who ordered was sitting behind me slurring his speech profoundly The boyfriend of the girl seemed OK and spoke to me and Jose As we drove the boyfriend spoke to Jose and they discussed how awesome the night was and Jose remarked about how utterly completely smash drunk he was and how he vomited in the bathroom many times

I could tell this was the case as there was a stench of vomit as he spoke I think other ants could attest to this you know the smell The boyfriend then told me that they do this a lot go out and get completely smash drunk Jose then told me and the boyfriend of the girl who has passed out how much he enjoyed the night

I wondered about this why people do this I got drunk oncebut just  The experience was so physically uncomfortable and I hated the feeling of a loss of control It would be like if I was driving a car and the steering wheel got a ton of play in it and the brakes were sluggish and the accelerator did not respond etc Can anyone comment as to why people do this I can not fathom how someone would regularly subject themselves to experiencing profound bodily sickness and a psychological loss of control

Anyhow when we got to the destination all three got out but the girlfriend was so disoriented Suddenly as she was walking she collapsed onto the pavementhard I was shocked and got out and I saw that Jose and the boyfriend lifted her and she seemed OK and smiled in an embarrassed way at me I asked if she was OK and all three assured me that she was The two guys put her arms on their shoulder and walked a few steps towards their apartment complex Butsuddenly both Jose AND the girlfriend collapsed onto the pavement Not slowly falling down and putting their outstretched hands downbut just fell flat very fast and hard I was alarmed and asked the boyfriend if they needed an ambulance But he said no I cautiously watched them to observe them for a few minutes They got up and all three went in shoulder to shoulder and sort of did a dance swaying side to side moving as one bodyuntil they disappeared right in the hallway

I am writing about this because I have documented before on UPnet some very alarming instances of brutal intoxication Can anyone hazard a guess as to why some pax do this on a routine basis It appears to me some type of mental issue or masochism Maybe once I can understand never to be repeated but to get smash drunk many times a month year after year and be pleased with the experience

We talked about his group of friends who he was playing the games with and one of them was a laid off airline engine mechanic at OHare airport I cant now remember the airline Anyway he said that his friend was asked back by the airline to start work again He told me his friend refused because of the extended unemployment until September his friend said that even though theres little chance of getting covid at his job because he is an airline mechanic he is entitled to a very long paid vacation after putting in so much time with the airline His other friends also felt the same way I browse through other websites on my downtime Majority of laid off workers with the extended unemployment PUA all feel that they deserve this gravy train

"Weekends are when I get my best stories and I thought this one was interesting I picked up a pax named William near the Merchandise Mart train station in downtown Chicago and we got to discussing the pandemic and how he was dealing with it He shared with me that just over a year ago he was let go from the most fun job he ever had He was working for Yelp the company who does the online reviews for restaurants and local businesses He said that it was by far the most fun he ever had and he was making great money

William said that the top salesman for the downtown Chicago office made over  in commission in a month before the pandemic crushed business He said he was one of the top salesman and made six figures Andhe loved the environment He told me about how there was prepandemic nearly  people in the Yelp downtown office and after you go through security it was a job workplace heaven He gave the funny analogy that the pit where everyone was selling was like in the movie Wolf of Wall Street and how when someone got a big sale everyone would know because some horn would go off and everyone would go over and congratulate the salesman He mentioned though there was no drugs or dwarfs thrown

The pax told me that there were ping pong tables other amenities like board games and lounge chairs to be used during break and FREE BEER and FREE FOOD And he said it was very good food all you can eat I was surprised because I thought that only like Amazon Facebook and Google had this type of workplace amenities I didnt know Yelp had that kind of money

William told me that the company really cared about making employees happy He said that as the pandemic crushed business Yelp tried hard to keep as many people onboard and on payroll He said that he started working remotely from home but it was totally soul crushing After all restaurants and businesses closed down and trying to get new clients was darn near impossible he said

He said Yelp paid some bonuses and tried and triedbut in the end it was not enough and he and most everyone was let go He said there is still a shell left of his team in the downtown Chicago office and he has no ill will towards his former company because they tried so hard to survive but the Chicago location collapsed anyhow After a few months on UI he found a job with FedEx as a driver and he was being dropped off in the Niles IL location by Touhy ave and Niles Center road He seemed happy enough as a FedEx employee and we both discussed that business was BOOMING for FedEx and his job is likely secure as an ironclad chain

But wistfully he lamented the loss of the best job he said he ever had in his life",0.9846,0.05,0.831,0.119,Positive,0.15,0.03,0.3,0.19,0.33,2021,Young Kim
"This is from theI wouldnt believe it unless I saw it myselffiles

Yesterday at about  AM I was stuck at a red light in heavy traffic in front of a McDonalds drive thru Apparently two vehicles had tried to enter the single DT lane at the same time a white van who was in the right appeared to have been first and had the legal ROW regardless and a red Ford Taurus that was trying to butt in front of him by entering from the busy avenue I was stuck on which is illegal to standstop on when trying to enter the DT lanes of this McD

Dude in the van is calmly talking out his window to the Taurus pax when the driver of the Taurus exits his vehicle and walks over to the van and proceeds to start punching the van driver So the van driver backs up parks and exits his vehicle with his cell phone held in a position that made it obvious he was filming Taurus driver grabs the cell and throws it Tom Brady style across all four lanes of traffic where it bounces against the side of the wall of a Money Mart and lands on the sidewalk Yes it was that kind of neighbourhood

Van driver runs across the traffic grabs his phone turns and runs back across the traffic but doesnt stop He picks up speed and when he is about  feet from the Taurus driver he jumps in the air Bruce Lee style and lands a left food directly on the Taurus drivers jaw sending him to the ground like a wet towel An EPIC take down to say the least

Taurus drivers GF gets out of the car yelling OMG youve killed Johnnyhes not dead BTW hes just lying flat on the parking lot like JC about to get nailed to the cross Van driver gets back in his van and drives away The red light changes color and I do the same

"On Saturday night at  am I had a pickup in Skokie IL a north suburb by AMC Theaters also near Red Robin and Buffalo Wild Wings I swiped right and saw the three young men entering my Uber were going to the Hyatt Place in Rosemont IL about a  minute ride Immediately I noticed they were drunk but even more vexingvery loud They began to ask me many questions about everything I answered abruptly with monosyllables They were loud ugh Then one of them got on their phone and put it on speaker and called some girl Then they all proceeded to have a group discussion of their night also asking me questions to try to involve me in their drunken talk 

It was the end of a long Saturday night which are always very taxing for an Uber ant Especially now during the pandemic it has gotten so very much worse So I was not in a mood to feign interest with  very loud annoying pax who was discussing their hard partying with some girl they all knew I could hear them talk stuff like Yeah when we sat down on the table and that other group approached I was pissed Dont you think that the promoter will be interested in holding that party for next weekendstuff like that

So I put on my Sony almost noise cancelling headphones with very snug earbuds and turned on some peaceful classical music at a loud volume I told them that I need to listen to the Uber navigation system to insure that I drive to their destination properly so I may not be able to communicate with them Suddenly as the soft notes of the symphony emerged the three annoying pax almost seemed to magically disappear from my car I could hear them still trying to talk to me gesturing at me and one even tapped my shoulder trying to get my attention

I did remove one earbud and asked Is there a problem and he answered No I just wanna ask you howthis and that I interrupted with So sorry but I need to hear the Uber navigation It is very important And then put back on my classical music 

Soooo nice It was suddenly like I was in another world of peace and harmony

I think they got the message because at the end of the ride they just got out without saying a word and I did not say goodnight either I recommend everyone get a pair of very snug blutooth headphones preferably noise cancelling which will drown out annoying pax I am doing this more and more now with great results

The only issue of course is that you wont be able to hear other traffic like someone honking their horn And most importantly you must redouble your sight for any emergency vehicles since you wont be able to hear sirens ButI think that at least for me it is totally worth it When an annoying pax is about to test my patience some Mozart Beethoven or Handel will help me immensely

For myself I care nothing at all about getting a one star review from the pax if they feel I am ignoring them If they are loud and obnoxious I put them on ignore with great satisfaction and relief",0.9673,0.111,0.752,0.137,Positive,0.12,0.08,0.18,0.26,0.36,2021,Young Kim

"Saturday night February th was a very unique evening in the sense that I nearly hit one pedestrian and had to brake rather hard for another but I saw the latter coming easily Also I very regrettably sent a bunny into rabbit heaven It was strange because I do sometimes have to narrowly avoid clueless pedestrians but this all happened within a short span of time in one night The first was the most jarring because I nearly without exaggeration came very close to striking a pax darting out from between two cars into another Uber I do just wish to point out that I was not speeding at all and rather driving about  miles under the speed limit 

I was driving southbound on Linder Ave approaching Lawrence Ave in the north side of Chicago and on a narrow street when a would be pax literally jumped out from between two cars and ran in front of my car to their Uber across the street I hit the brake and gasped at how close I came to hitting himher After stopping I saw the other Uber ants face who was parked look at me and we both shook our heads in disbelief His pax in a white parka jacket with fur on the hoodie so I could not see the face jumped into the Uber completely not even acknowledging that heshe I could not tell almost got seriously injured The street was  mph so if I did not brake hard I doubt the pax would have had life threatening injuries but heshe would have been gravely hurt

How many of you have had a person sprint in front of your vehicle running for their own Uber

Next I was driving west on Harrison Street by Halsted next to the UIC campusk a short while later and I saw a bunny suddenly jump into the street in a hurry I slammed on the brakes I was doing an UberEats order so there was no pax in my car and veered right fast As the car decelerated quickly I thought I cleared the bunny easilybutit jumped back right into my path under my tires in the last split second

Squirrels very common I have avoided easily because they move in a predictable trajectory and at constant velocity and zero acceleration Deer are easy to avoid because they are large and move slowly Geese or birds are even easier because they move either very very slowly or just fly away But this bunny was moving and darting all over the place As it jumped into my path it hopped like up left down and then finally back to my rightjust as I thought I missed it I heard a thud I felt awful and disgusted then hoped that it was not the bunny

I slowly backed up away left from centerbut I saw the heap of rabbit lying in the road I am not sure why that bothered me so much but I felt really awful But not guilty Because I knew that I did everything I could to avoid that bunny Plus I was as I always am paying close attention to animals And I was not speeding at all It was the very first time in my life I hit a bunny and noted that I could not have predicted its movement as it seemed in retrospect completely random and unpredictable Its last jump was right into my tire pathssigh

And so surprisingly because it happened again shortly later my next pax pickup was further south in the south side of Chicago by Roosevelt Ave and Racine Ave a rather faster moving bigger street  mph I saw a man just run across the street in front of my car However I saw him running from the sidewalk easily as his path was not obscured by cars like the first pedestrian I mentioned who appeared suddenly in between two parked cars I ended up braking hard though and he slowly just walked in front of my car as I came to a complete stop I was a bit unhappy that some people just run into the street even on a busy street without looking at ALL 

I am certain that all Uber ants have come close to hitting clueless pedestrians and likely causing roadkill of animals through no fault of their own But have any of you actually HIT a pedestrian Please do share your story of near misses",-0.9887,0.12,0.808,0.071,Negative,0.05,0.14,0.21,0.27,0.34,2021,Young Kim

"OK just when I thought this job cannot get any worse it did tonight a couple of hours ago I would like to ask at the end if anyone has had a most frustrating pax than the one I just had The pax was a long pickup in Des Plaines IL The name on the app was Jordan this is in the northwest suburbs of Chicago IL in a middle class suburb Pax came out of a nice apartment complex The pax comes out and everything starts off OK But then he asks me Do you have an aux cord Warning to newbies never ever offer an aux cord if asked pax will demand you play their music at full blast on repeat the entire ride I said no of course Then he asks if he can Blutooth his phone to my car speaker system I replied of course No sir my blutooth system does not work

Jordan tells me that he wishes to have me listen to his and his friend Kuta Magnificents recent hip hop song which he argued would be the single top most downloaded song on Spotify predicting at least a BILLION downloads I said so sorry Jordan but my blutooth system does not work but if you tell me the song Ill look it up after I get home tonight OK Jordan just gets his phone out and starts playing his and his friends song  but the song title was  thats right that  was the name of the song

I could not believe the garbage that came out of his phone Mind you I enjoy all music including hiphop and rap music But his song In the Shit was  minutes of a guy singing He is in the shit Bweetch you all know the actual word is in the shit My boy is in the shit the Nword is in the shit My homie is in the shit interspersed with all manner of profanity and vulgar language describing criminal behavior like shooting drugs defaming women committing crimes etc I heard the song  times in the  minute ride I had to bear hearing some guy rapping the words  probably more than two hundred times I tried to be polite but I could feel my remaining feelings of positivity towards pax being wiped away like a vestigial organ or decaying body part

He asked me to be friends on Facebook and Instagram over and over I replied Sorry Uber community guidelines prohibit such communication Then at the end of the ride he asked me AGAIN if I could look him up on Instagram and download and listen AGAIN to his fabulous song In the Shit and tell all my friends about it He said he and his friend Kuta Magnificent would become big as big as Drake Lil Wayne JayZ and The Weeknd Now I really enjoy much of the work of the previous artists But his song In the Shit was literally the worst piece of hiphop I have ever heard

I already had a stacked order right behind this ride and so I told Jordan that I cannot stop and look up and download his song In the Shit I showed him on my app the green dot after his ride proving that I indeed had another rider who had been waiting a very long time I told him that the next rider is already waiting  minutes and therefore I could not take any more time since the ride was over At the end of the ride when we reached the destination I swiped right and asked very politely if he would exit the vehicle since the next rider had been waiting

Then he got upset and really bizarre

Jordan said his real name was Kuta Amazing not Jordan so I really dont know his real name now He kept insistingthen  that I look up and download his song and spread the incredible work of art of his and his friends to my friends and my social media connections When I said I cannot right then but I will do so after my shift was over he started calling me a dumb Asian boy over and overlike  times He said I was missing out on letting others know how great his song In the Shit was

I steadfastly insisted that he exit my vehicle he just refused over and overand just sat there He argued that the next passenger does not have a song as great as his so I would be justified in making the next passenger wait I replied that it is unlikely that the next pax is even a hiphop singer Also I tried to explain to him that it was very inconsiderate to make someone wait for such an endeavor

Then he got quiet and I started to feel a bit nervous Maybe  seconds passed of silence and I contemplated calling for help through the Uber app or  But this was a moment to try to prevent any escalation I was in a safe middle class neighborhood in Illinois after all And he was not being immediately threatening Rather he was simply refusing to exit the vehicle and seemed insulted that I would not download his song then and there

I tried to say encouraging things positive things to make him feel better and have him exit the vehicle Finally a car approached from behind us and I told him that I must insist that he exit the vehicle immediately As I drove forward to allow the car behind me to pass he  opened the car door put his feet out as his legs dragged across the cement and yelled Bweetch why are you moving the fing car I immediately thought to myself WHY ARE YOU OPENING THE CAR DOOR AND TRYING TO STEP OUT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING I was stunnedhe could have seriously injured himself

I stopped fast to avoid him being dragged under my wheels When the car stopped he finally got out Never was I more happy that a ride had ended Strangely he waved bye to me and smiled

Since the pandemic began this job has gotten more and more challenging as the months have passed I have driven without interruption all months of the past year To those of you sitting this out during the pandemic it is likely a very wise decision I think my sanity is slowly withering away I think I may start posting like  or maybe far far worse soon if this constant march of negativity does not destroy the final fragments of love and faith I have left for humanity As I drove off I literally thought I was dreaminghaving a terrible nightmare Like I really could not believe I had such a crazy passenger I reflect now that maybe he was high on Crystal Meth or Crack Cocaine

Below I will upload a one minute video YouTube link of Jordan or maybe his name is actually Kuta Amazing at the end of the ride as he refused to exit my vehicle You can hear at least one instance of him calling me  he called me that at least  times at the end of the trip just because I refused to sit and download onto my phone his magnum opus In the Shit I can see that upon listening to the audio that I am talking rather fast normally I do not But I was very agitated on trying to have him exit my vehicle ASAP Also I did not take video footage of his face


At this point I am sure everyone knows that I really try my best to be as patient compassionate and caring as a person should while driving Uber But after this ride I can see how people can lose their sanity I am hoping  does not have to read a post of mine in the future where I demonstrate an unbridled hatred of humans I cannot allow myself to go there

Finally I wish to state unequivocally that I was NOT exaggerating the utter sheer insanity of this pax and the aspects of this ridethis all really happened Before anyone questions why I did not yell and scream at the passenger to Get the F out of my car you had to see him and how bizarre he was acting at the end I thought it best to not agitate him",0.9983,0.099,0.75,0.152,Positive,0.09,0.04,0.3,0.19,0.38,2021,Young Kim

 minutes later I get a   rating pop up Oh well dont really care about the rating This morning I realize his story was detailed enough that it should show in my dash cam You can clearly see him walking up to my car with empty hands You can see him get in the car and his right hand is clearly empty You can see him answer his phone and never have a wallet or put it down

"All these long hours trying in vain to keep positive are weighing me down and I can sense darker feelings coming over me Around  am I had a pickup at a bar in the northwest suburbs of Chicago in Arlington Heights After the pax made me wait I remember her name was Patricia for  minutes I saw her come out in a group of  I rolled down my window and said Sorry but there is too many people 

She was clearly drunk and her face was red She just stared with glassy eyes for a short while silently and then said Well can you still take me and my friends home 

I said Sorry too many people I have a cooler and a bunch of stuff in my front passenger seat

She replied Cant you move the stuff to the trunk Ill tip you

I replied to her that I could even though it is against Uber policy but it may be easier for her to order a second Uber

At this point she acted all entitled and she said angrily What is wrong with you Are you OK Are you OK to take us home

I felt something in me snap I thought to myself obviously why the heck would I not be OK it is you that is not OK because you are an angry drunk

I abruptly said to her Hey Im cancelling this ride I did nothing wrong here and suddenly you are being rude to me I dont take rude customers She just stared at me in shock and disbelief but then I think it dawned on her that she made a mistake 

I felt such a joy cancelling on her She did not think this through Tonight the wait times especially in the suburbs were LONG Like  minutes long Andpeople were telling me that Ubers were cancelling on them And the bar she was at with her friends was closing And some pax were telling me that they saw the dreaded Sorry no UberXs in your area pls try again later in the northwest suburbs where I was driving She may have to wait for  minutes or longer and would have to beg the bar to let her and her friends stay inside until another Uber shows up

Drunk entitled pax often act in a manner that is completely illogical and detrimental She probably thought in her drunken state that she could be rude and order the Uber drivers to do whatever she wanted 

Big mistake this was not preCovd in the middle of downtown Chicago Her friends who were sober knew instantly the mistake Patricia made and apologized and asked if I would bring them anyway 

I said No I knew also that once the ride started she would complain and give me crap the entire ride and obviously one star me which I dont care about but I didnt want to deal with an angry drunk pax INSIDE my car I found that if the pax before the ride even starts sniffs of a problem it is better to cut your losses and get out of there",-0.9883,0.175,0.717,0.109,Negative,0.06,0.09,0.31,0.28,0.26,2021,Young Kim

"This was an interesting ride in the sense that it echoes more or more of what I am experiencing with pax I picked up a couple of young men in the southwest suburbs of Chicago Western Springs and brought them all the way up to the north side of Chicago In this long ride I had a lot of time to talk to them Both were out of school now and wanted to become YouTube TikTok Instagram stars They wanted to make it as recording artistsacross social media They told me that they do livestream feeds where people tune into their work and as I understood it they mix music like hiphop

Where it became more interesting to me was that they gave up looking for a stable job because the price of Bitcoin was soaring so much that they felt they will never have to work a real job again for the rest of their lives I did check after the ride ended and I just saw it hit around  per Bitcoin I feel like the pandemic low last year was around  They kept telling me that I should invest heavily in it they spoke of it almost as if it was a new religion They were talking one million dollars per Bitcoinand stuff like that

I heard that Uber may accept Bitcoin as paymentor some rumors of that

I wished them well and for their sake I hope that they achieve their dreams But I wondered to myself if this is the right attitude Can a plethora of young college agecollege graduates decide and become successful cryptocurrency investors and not have to work any real jobs 

I am not sure if such an attitude is best I do own some Bitcoin actually and I dont recommend it or not recommend it herebut I wanted to share an interesting story about how many young people are banking on the price of it to allow them never to do  again I am not so sure if that is a good plan Even if it works our economy will still need people to work right",0.985,0.028,0.852,0.12,Positive,0.08,0.04,0.08,0.25,0.54,2021,Young Kim

They turned off all internet delivery apps after the first  hours around  PM because they were getting slammed on all fronts DD UE and STD and could not handle it Mainy the apps though were causing the trouble Too many people ordering and no kitchen can keep up too many customers complaining losing  in fees and having things sit an hour plus for pickups was the reason As these are the least profitable orders by far they got whacked

Next was pick ups for take out from their own website which were averaging about  orders every  minutes for about  hours straight They track this metric in  minute segments apparently and promote it with discounts and a points program for members

"It started off fine I picked up  pax at a bar in a suburb south of the city around  am It was a couple The guy suddenly started asking me if I was Korean I replied Yes sir I am He proceeded to ask me  times exactly if I was Korean on a  minute ride Each time I would answer Yes After around the th time I started counting it back to him Yes I am Korean that is for the nd timeYes I am Korean for the rd timeYes I am Korean for the th time etc At this point I went from being annoyed to very amused

The girlfriend who was very cute started to apologize profusely and kept telling her boyfriend to shut up She was quite friendly and tried to divert the repeated questions to other topics She asked me if I thought she was fit and cute showed me her stomach to which I replied Of coursehavent you seen a mirror recently

Then the boyfriend suddenly started asking me  are you Korean over and over

I calmly replied that both my parents are Korean so my genetics followed from that biological fact He in his drunken state started to repeat that same question over and over afraid to get to the th time for that question I cut him off I then answered by having a short talk about how there are  chromosomes in each cell of my body consisting of  pairs and two sex chromosomesinheritance patterns etc And all this explains why my being Korean has a logical connection to my parents being Korean

For my own amusement I quickly pointed out how traits are inherited from each parent through DNA transmission according to Mendelian genetics and again tried to explain that is the reason I am in fact Korean and not another race

After a long silent pause he again askedSowhy are you Korean

I tried so hard not to laugh

At the end of the ride the girlfriend apologized again for her boyfriend and then handed me a twenty The boyfriend gets out and is suddenly very friendly with me and asked his girlfriend if she had tipped me well She replied that she did and both disappeared into their apartment building

"I have mixed feeling about pax the same as I would about any John and Jane Doe with whom Id have to interact with out there I guess

But there is one variety of pax who I appreciate more than mostits the pax who unknowingly aids and abets me to weed out their low payingpotentially problematic rides by outing themselves with messages which reveal the true colors of what might transpire if I dare PU at their pin drop

Upon receipt of such messages I quickly cancel then recast my net for higher paying rideslower drama rides saving me the hassle of having to haul it  mins down the road only to see a nonsensical ride that I cant work with

This is a thank you to them because they keep my economic fly wheel turning without having to break my vibe or mess up my bottom line

The pax who sends these revealing message is indeed a special onebecause unlike their stealthier counterparts who KNOW what theytheir rides are so mask their true location andor identity or continually launch new accounts to woo drivers back into their den they volunteerily tip their hand to show me the kinda of ride most likely to suck time money and energy out of my hustle possibility ending my hustle on a sour note

These message are super helpful in my market where UL dont show pax destination until you accept all the  min away rides and score a  AR or something like which I DONT haveone can sniff out rides which dont make financial sense by simply reading and understanding these pax messages

Here are a few of my choice favorites with interpretations

Pax message We are at the Circle K and its am just scored and need a mule bruh

Pax message I have a lot of groceries so can you load our  carts full drive  miles park your nice new car in section  housing after dark and leave it unattended to run my stuff up  flights of stairs for  andooh dont worry because Ill take care of you on the app

The best one is

Pax message You are picking my son up from middle school school thus violating your ToS on a ride which is not only awkward but not completely legal and can result in legal action

By the waythis message is a good one to screen shot and then dash to UL inviting them to discuss ToS with pax

Okay I know chances are real slim that Juan will ever read this

Yesterday around  PM I get a ping for a trip  miles south estimated to be  minutes long I pull up and there are  ladies mom and and two teens estimated in the  year old range I verify identity and they all pile in the back seat I know this trip is going to an area that is farther away from my house and chances of getting a ride back to my area will be slim but oh well

Mom immediately gets on the phone and says we are in a second Uber and should be there in less than an hour My mind starts to wonder Several minutes later Mom gets on the phone again and I hear here say ride issue okay she is on the phone with Uber support After some frustration she gets connected to a person

Basically Juan in a red Toyota Sienna came to pick them up After they were in the car he started the trip and saw where they are going Guessing Juan does not have Uber Pro Status She said Juan proceeded to demand a  cash tip up front because he would have to drive back  miles with no pay She refused Juan kicked them out and drove off

She was going off on the Uber rep on the phone she also had to repeat twice to the rep No not Paul I am in his car now and we are heading to our hotel it was Juan that was the problem

Juan demanded  kicked out his PAX and his PAX rewarded me with a nice crisp  bill upon arrival to their resort She thanked me for a nice safe professional ride

I pull over and start getting my license registration and proof of insurance ready turn on the interior lights roll down all the windows and place my hands on top of the steering wheel I look in my driver rearview mirror and dont see anything I look in the windshield rearview mirror and catch a glimpse of movement on the passenger side I look in the passenger side rearview mirror and see a female deputy reach over and touch the back of my car with her left hand then I see she has her gun drawn in her right hand

She gets to the rear passenger window and looks in and says you are not the car we are looking for you can go Before I know what is going on she is back in her car and driving off

Turns out the PAX tell me some guy came in yelling and screaming and threatened to kick every ones ass and shoot up the place Caused the place to empty out pretty quick as last call was at  and they close at  Explains why the parking lot was so empty",-0.3612,0.093,0.824,0.083,Negative,0.13,0.04,0.2,0.15,0.48,2020,FLKeys

"So this isnt so much a story as it is an observationthat RS drivers ability to bargain for more equitable termstreatment is disabled by all the hobby drivers who arent grinding it to make rent but just do RS to get out of the house for a Dunkin Donuts run score some decaf and a danish and then what the heck pick of a pax or two maybe a few then head back home for a visit from the grandkids

Are you a hobby driver Do you know who these guys are Well

I recently relocated to Tucson sunbird central but still fly now and again for work so of course use RSthe drivers picking me during day hours not night are kindly retired oldtimers who drive all leisurely and seem oblvious to what they might make or not make per ride

An example

Me Hey I also do RS hows it been going for you in Tucson

Ernie Oh you know I dont know I just do it now and again get a break from the mrs its good to get out of that place at least one day and see whats going on out here hehehe

Me Oh cool ok good to make some money too Are there rides you tend to prefer or avoid

Ernie Nope I just drive whatever I go whereever pick up anyone

Me Whoa thats different becausefor example I avoid Walmart I dont make enough money on those having to load and off load  carts of groceries

Ernie Ohhhhhh I dont mind those but I cant get out to help because of my back and my knees

Me Butthe wait like they only pay us  cents a min Mann I cant work for that can you

Ernie Is that what they pay I didnt even knowhow much do they pay per mile I dont much pay attention to these thing you know I just drive need to get out of the house once in a while but not too long or wifey might think I have a girlfrend ahhahha


I took Ernies number he was cool friendly and I could call him direct for my airport runs and put  of the fare in his pocket though he probably doesnt care

Ive noticed that pax have going bonkers on the multistops and grocery store PUs during the pandemic AND because these rides keep coming and coming I figure enough drivers are accepting these PUs otherwise RS would drop them OR offer drivers more moneyI wont touch these PUs and dash them away I used to wonder WHO picks up my leftovers it seems these hobby drivers happily take them RS is neat hobby but drivers who are you hustling it to make rent and pay for college etc wont be able to advocate for better pay with all these guys out there

Potential pax Could you please open the door
Me Ummm how many are in your party
Potential girl pax  of us
Me Ummm there cant be anyone in the front seat
Potential girl pax Well all of us can squeeze in the back seat

Me Umm Im so sorry but
Potential girl pax Please we waited so long for an Uber
Me Can you please order an XL
Potential girl pax We cant find one
Me How about two UberXs
Potential girl pax Please can you fit all of us
 Im really thinking here then why didnt they order  Ubers but I realized this crowd was a few cards short of a full deck at this point and this was the kind of bizarre behavior I would have expected over a year ago but now Where were these people living I am now thinking that there was more than just alcohol involved in their past social gathering
Me Im so sorry But it would be totally unsafe Then I cancelled and drove off

My very next request was a ping to the Elmhurst Police Station I figured immediately it was a DUI situation as it was  am in the morning When I got to the pickup location the pax was nowhere to be found Then I received a text message

Potential pax Could you pick us up We are walking down st Ave I think it was st Ave
Me I dont know where exactly you are could you give me a cross street or address
Potential pax We dont know where we are my buddy got a DUI and we are walking home
Me Then why did you order an Uber I was only  minutes from the pickup location so it wasnt as if they were waiting long for the pickup
Potential pax I dunno but we are walking down some street and there is a stoplight in front of me
Me Sorry sir that does not help me
Potential pax Well we are almost home now could you cancel the ride We are so sorry to bother you
Me Well you should cancel the ride
Potential pax OK good night
Me OK bye

I waited til the timer ran down but he cancelled right at the end Easiest  bucks I made that night  times  cancellation fee

"Here in Pensacola Florida passengers often ask how I did during the worst of the pandemic lockdowns and such They ask it in a concerned tone of voice as if they assume Ive done poorly But I tell em Great The truth is that I did not miss a day of work and I did not see any loss of business I attribute this to two things

 There are plenty of people in my town who had to work  those employed by convenience stores and fastfood joints nursing homes and restaurantsin other words essential or exempted businesses Many of my passengers were from a ahem lowerincome strata of society and to work But also many of them did not have cars and have come to rely on RS to get to and from work



 I assume that a lot of UberLyft drivers are older and many of them may have health issues otherwise theyd all probably have regular jobs My thinking goes that because many RS drivers fall into one or more atrisk category they stopped driving out of as they say on TV an abundance of caution End result Fewer drivers on the road competing for the rides

Whatever the actual reasons I did not have to stop driving nor did I lose any income at all in  I hit all of my admittedly modest daily income targets and I found that I could achieve them in fewer hours per day than in the prepandemic days Most days it was nonfriggin stoppingpingping I worked hard all my life I did not take this job so I could work hard some more Sometimes Id kind of feel guilty about stopping early and abandoning passengers who needed rides But after my second beer those feeling passed

I am only able to drive nights and early mornings for good reasons so my experiences are often fun

So picked up a pax black woman who was doing athome care that kept me waiting for two minutes but she apologized as soon as she got in the car so I thought nothing of it as she seemed nice

We made our first stop at a gas station nearby that took her  minutes she got in the car and I was driving to her destination when her tone did a  flip and she harangued me for following the GPS route which was only  seconds and one turn away from the only possible logical subsequent route

She was really turning nasty and irrational even as I pointed out the route was the fastest and lowest milage possible of three options on waze  uber nav so I pulled over cancelled the ride and asked her to leave my car

She refused unleashed a further torrent of abuse so for the first time ever after  rides I called  to get her out of my car

I gave the operator an accurate description of my car with hazards on and a squad car blew right past my vehicle even after me flashing my hibeams

Two more  calls of police fail gods help me if I am ever being assaulted and an hour later another uber arrived and she got out maskless after calling me among other insults a n word

I called diamond support with my story informing them that I had dashcam footage of the whole trip but they said that they could not expunge the  she gave me

I drove to the nearest cop shop and a Sgt stated that no crime was committed as I initially invited her into my car despite me repeatedly telling her to leave

I checked the ride andit was long like  mins but most of it on the interstate and at least it was another residential not commercial address so I could probably get him out the car and to the doorstep or on his lawn He was too blasted to be any trouble to me though he might throw up in route

I decided the quickest route out of this situation would be to simply hustle him from point A to point B

Thats what I did

I gunned it up the  to cut the time got him to the addressparked and woke him up

He was still too sloshed to talk butlooked slowing around seemed to recognize his place and pointed at it and grinned

Ok great I helped him out the car and luckily the  min cat nap revived enough of his motor abilities that he could sorta make a slow zigzap like walk to his house without my help I wanted as little end game involvement as possibleI watched him enter ended the ride then got the hell outta there logged off and went home No more Friday night drunks",-0.9666,0.133,0.781,0.085,Negative,0.11,0.09,0.24,0.17,0.39,2021,#1husler

"I have a regular pax that I have driven tofrom her work as well as a few other places over the past year She lives in the housing projects she is quiet and polite  most of the time On a couple occasions I drove her together with a friend and she was a different person snippy and somewhat rude Since I encounter other snippy and rude pax this didnt really bother me However two incidents made this a problem About a week ago I got a ping to pick her up a few blocks from her home The address is a location where there have been a half dozen shootings in the past month also public housing I stopped on the street and carefully monitored my surroundings including the large parking lot of front of the apartment buildings that I assumed the pax would come from I waited about two minutes and a young man approached across the grass said Lyft I answered No and got this in reply Then get your bitch ass out the street I immediately obliged and left canceled and got the fee I got an immediate phone call from the pax I told her what happened and she screamed Thats my brother Too bad 

This past Saturday night I got a ping to pick her up at her workplace When I arrived after a couple minutes four young people two girls and two boys my regular was not one of them came running out laughing all carrying several large bags from the closed store I suspected they had just enjoyed a private nocharge shopping spree but Im not going to judge They surrounded the car and began yelling talking excitedly and yanking on my door handles Only one was wearing a mask I called out Sorry Maximum three passengers Masks required This resulted in an immediate chorus of vociferous verbal abuse Flashback to a couple hundred traffic stops One maskless young man approached my door and pressed his body against my partially open window and proceeded to give me some serious hood eyes and attitude I repeated the rules realizing that he was very close to attacking me called out Watch your feet and pulled away quickly As I did he threw a handful of something in my face most bounced off the window but a couple hit me Throwing a missile at a moving car in Virginia is a felony The missiles turned out to be French fries but I have gotten this offense charged before for rocks gravel a book a bunch of keys and an apple to name a few other missiles 

I went around the corner canceled and got the fee Called support described the incident they escalated to another team immediately and I described everything again to a very articulate intelligent sounding support rep Within half an hour I got an email saying that I would not be matched to this person again and then a bit later another email adding that she had been banned from the platform Satisfying but I wonder how long that ban will last Also since I have taken several other pax to from this girls workplace chances are good that Ill see her again That will be interesting The most annoying part of this to me is that in spite of two dangerous incidents involving residents of the same housing projects and in spite of multiple shootings in that location recently Im guessing that if a pax complains that I would not pick them up because of their race Ill get deactivated Do me a favor I suppose but I do enjoy having this part time gig available My cancelation rate is going to continue to climb",-0.9871,0.132,0.795,0.074,Negative,0.12,0.02,0.24,0.3,0.31,2021,Cvillegordo

Yesterday I did my first airport run and as usual I turned on last ride before I got there as I dont want a rematch if there is no surge I dropped off the PAX and see that there is a  surge I go to turn ride requests back on and get the message there is a problem with your account

Open it up and have to agree to a background check do that and it gives me suggestions to read wile I wait

Cant go online and score a surge ride Oh well I head home I start thinking about the posts I read here about how it took weeks to get back online I was getting pissed that they did this to me on a Sunday a good money day

"So I was in the west side of Chicago which is a relatively dangerous area doing an Uber Eats order for a burger king The delivery just completed at  am When I made the delivery the lady came down and said could you please deliver it to some other address So I told her let me GPS it and find out where it was She gave me an address that was about  minutes away by cicero and Chicago avenue

Since the delivery address could not be changed on the app she suggested that she could pay me in cash I agreed because there was no real way to change it through the app anymore When I asked her how much should be willing to pay she surprised me and said  I seriously thought she was just going to offer  because it wasnt very far

So she pulled out a  bill and  singles and just handed it to me and said you look like someone I can trust

so I just exchanged phone numbers with her so that I could contact her when I got to the delivery location so her friend could come down and retrieve the food The delivery went without a hitch and she took me even tipped me more on the app afterward

This was quite a surprise so I just wanted to share this I was surprised that somebody would be so willing to trust someone after the delivery was complete and also offer such a enormous amount of money for such a short distance Im glad that I give off that vibe that I am a trustworthy person",0.9689,0.036,0.849,0.116,Positive,0.06,0.06,0.27,0.18,0.42,2021,Young Kim

She was upset because most all her coworkers decided to take the unemployment but for whatever reason that I couldnt figure out she did not get it herself She said her manager was quite upset because he couldnt get enough workers And she was not happy that she picked up all these extra hours that she really didnt want because her manager asked her that someone HAD to do those hours

She was also upset at us Uber drivers as well She doesnt drive and she uses Uber exclusively to get to work and from work back to home These days she has to wait up to  minutes to get an Uber so to be safe she plans one full hour earlier for her commute

"So tonight Sunday I went out after tutoring a student in math and got a ping that was twenty minutes away by Lake Michigan I was about to cancel but I got a phone call from the pax I answered and there was a frantic voice on the other end

pax Please save us We are stuck in the Chicago Botanical Gardens and we have a child in a strollerand we are freezing

me What is going on

She explained that when the Chicago Botanical Gardens closed she her boyfriend and her baby left thinking that they can easily get home She tried to get an Uber and Lyft but all cancelled one after another after another She had been out in the cold with her boyfriend and child for nearly an hour She said they were freezing in the cold and sounded totally desperate She said her and her boyfriends phone was about to die and I was basically the last hope

They saw some light show at the Botanical Gardens and the place had closed a while back I agreed to get them I drove the twenty minutes from like west of Northfield to the gardens When I got there I saw that the entrance road INTO the gardens was closed I called her and asked her where she was and that I could not get in

She sounded increasingly frantic and said there was no one there around them to ask and it was so dark I guess all the staff left and they were all alone She could not make out anything except that her boyfriend and baby and her were next to a big lit up Christmas tree I then put my hazards on and drove around until I saw an open road but it was an exit only road It was one way the wrong way but I went anyway because it was private property and there were no other cars anywhere so I could see if there would be a car driving towards meeg I drove through one of the exit roads that led OUT of the gardens and into the park

I drove around for a bit looking for them and she stayed on the phone while I drove I could not see any lit up Christmas tree The Chicago Botanical Gardens is HUGE and finding a few people in the dark seemed hopeless She said she and her boyfriend were getting completely panicked because the boyfriends phone was about to die and hers was as well I said I would continue to search and said I would find help

As I drove around for a while I finally saw a car in the distance with a man wearing a shirt with those yellow florescent strips on it I was so happy to see him as there seemed to be NOBODY else in the park I think it was around  pm at night I drove right up and explained the situation I put her on and she told him about the surroundings

He immediately knew where it was and said he would drive there and have me follow him So I did

About a minute later we both saw them and the baby stroller

They ran up shivering They both thanked me and the man who helped me find them After getting in she explained again how she requested and got cancelled on again and again and again

She said I was like a savior today like a ER doctor firefighter or other rescue worker She said that without me they were about to completely panic as they saw no other way to get home I drove them about  minutes to Rogers Park IL to their apartment She told me her life story which was so interesting and full of adventure She was  years old and inexperienced about life She thanked me over and over again about my not cancelling on her and how I was so great because I did not give up on her her boyfriend and her baby boy She said that Christ answered her prayers today She explained that she saw no other way of getting home if it were not for me

When the ride ended I showed her and her boyfriend a few magic tricks like this one that I thought the young child would like


I am posting this feel good story because there was a moment like today where I felt really happy that I could help someone as an Uber driver She made me feel like a hero ",0.9925,0.081,0.793,0.126,Positive,0.09,0.02,0.23,0.2,0.46,2021,Young Kim
"A while back I did the Santander Uber lease I know I know A year into the lease the car was totalled by another driver and because he was underinsured Ubers insurer at the time James River paid me the value of the car

James River assessed the value of the car at  and Santander said the payoff amount or the money still owed to them in the lease contract was  James River said that they would send the settlement to Santander whom they expected to deduct the payoff amount and send me the  balance

When I got in touch with Santander to let them know what was happening they claimed that since the car belonged to them they would be keeping the whole settlement from the insurer

I responded that although they owned the car I owned the insurance policy and was the insured and beneficiary of it not Santander I told them that a lienholder is entitled to their financial interest in the asset not a penny more or a penny less However Santander insisted that they would take all the money

I called James River again The said that Santanders position was highly unusual They told me the same as I told Santander  I was the insured and was the one entitled to the settlement less any lien balance due They agreed to send Santander a check for the payoff amount and a separate check to me The loss adjuster said that this was the first time he had ever had to do that 

I phoned Santander to inform them that I had bypassed them that theyd only be getting the  and that they should be grateful for it I never heard from them again

My question is has anyone else ever come across such a scam attempt by Santander or other finance house when they have a lien on your car and your car is totalled out by an insurer for more than the payoff amount",0.9287,0.018,0.912,0.07,Positive,0.11,0.0,0.24,0.13,0.53,2021,The Gift of Fish

Yesterday I got ping in Tucson did the PU only to see that the pax was going to the ArizonaMexico border at Nogales about  mins down the I He asked me if it was ok and I decided Id go for it because I had time its a beautiful drive and a neat place

On arrival at the border at Nogales the pax informed me that he wanted to me to drive him across the border into Mexico and then another  hours to Puerto Penasco Rocky Point and would pay me  It seemed a bad idea for a number of reasons such asthat road is in very poor condition a storm washed it away years ago the wait to reenter the US is looong oh and my car isnt insured in Mexico etc etc

So I declined the offer and instead advised the pax about how to take bus from the Mexican side of the border left him there to cross on foot did my shopping then drive an hour up to Green ValleyHappy Valley to get rides up back to Tucson",0.1215,0.058,0.878,0.064,Negative,0.07,0.07,0.07,0.21,0.59,2021,#1husler

She said she and her buddies DONT like the Lyft Nazi and were always one starring this dude and complainingbut that hes still out there plying our roadsId think he more or less has the right to state his TOS and pax can consent or not none of this technically conflicts with Lyft TOS so hed be good to gojust that his rating would plummet but then hed get deactivated for that too right

In February of  he discovered that his mother died suddenly of a brain aneurysm He was distraught and he quit his job and returned home to the Phillippines After just ONE MONTH his father diedpresumably from a broken heart Therefore he quit his job as a cruise ship worker and came to the United States Chicago to be with his wifefinally

They now have a one month old babyand his wife is taking time off as a CNA to take care of his daughter Now he says he is really happy But he really misses the cruise ship lifestyle He did tell me that being away from his wife for almost the entire year was really hard and stressful on the marriage He did say he had his own cabin because he was a supervisor and there were many temptations He did relay the message that cruise ship workers get down with each other all the time I did NOT ask him personal questions I knew it was not my place to do so but I sensed

So they got very very upset And asked me if I could change it and drive them anyway I said no but they could change the address on their app After that he got suddenly very upset and stormed out and slammed the door I called out to him one last time and so sorry for what happened But he just ignored me completely and went into atrium of his building

The second rider was even more puzzling At the end of the ride I told him so the ride is over thank you have a nice day and have a good night and I hope you have a wonderful rest of the year He said thank you and then he proceeded to walk around to the other side of the car opened the door and then got in Fully expecting the ride to start 

I smiled a big grin and said sorry sir but were at your home thats the destination that you put He just sat there for a whilelike  full seconds and stared at me and then looked at his phone and called somebody and then got out of the car again and said thank you and have a good night

I was talking to Tron on another thread I have been getting  extra on every ride in my Chevy Bolt for the past  weeks and wasnt sure if it was just regular quest of if it was because of Ubers EV Green program looks like I am getting the  extra per ride because of the EV green program And the payouts continue until Sept of   Thats a big deal I though I could pull in  extra based on my  rides aday but looks like they limit it to  still a big deal though







The Bolt is one of very few at a price that makes sense to buy that actually give you enough range  miles on a charge the new s miles

"I havent posted stories in just a little while because I was SO busy over the holidays working multiple jobs family parties and doing RS of course Three stories stand out I Picked up a guy named Abdul in Rogers Park from a  He was incredibly friendly He came out and asked right away if I wanted a free drink at his  because he works there I said sure Ill take a slurpee So I went in and got one and of course showed him a cool magic trick to thank him He was amazed

Anyways he told me a sad story about how during the holidays he wont be able to see his wife and  year old daughter because they are in Pakistan He said he was a refugee and went through multiple countries to seek asylum in the US He was a strong antiMuslim in Pakistan so he had to flee suddenly He has not seen his young wife and daughter in many years He is very sad about this He is trying to get them to the US but he said it is near impossible now with the pandemic He said he has a meeting with his caseworker in January Ill pray for him please do so yourself

We finished the ride and he was just the nicest guy you can imagine I am just so sad that he had to separated from his wife and daughter because he would have been jailed or worse back in his home country Anyhow I showed him this trick five singles to five twenties some of you already saw this in the Chatter Section and he was so blown away and we laughed and laughed By the way I always carry a few magic tricks in my car for my passengers I often do Uber after work at a bar or restaurant so I have them with me Abdul loved this and said to me how unexpected it was to see an Uber driver do magic

Long story short it takes numerous back and forth communications only to learn that the line in my new home is still registered with the previous tenant It is not a news how incompetent Uber support is  reading scripts that are not relevant to the question You think it is the worst customer support Look at this Xfinity agent who kept me waiting for half an hour only to hang up im mad

"To my friends from Lyft why have you been peppering my inbox with these messages


The reason I and in fact MANY drivers dont accept some ride requests is because your platform remains riddled with a number of rides which pay significantly less than minimum wage

I concur its best for the community to score a return trip McDs drive thru run for  and pay me  for  mins of my time gas and cars weartear the community always appreciates a timely Walmart pick up to cram two shopping carts worth of groceries a toddler service dog into my car to drive  mile down the road and pay me  for that  min jobI know third parties dependent on outsourcing rides with no tips allowed for their patients who need drivers to drive them home hold their hands and walk them to their resident doors at times asking the drivers to open the doors and turn on the lights etc which is awkward and risky

Yes those are few sample of the substantial number of missed ride requests to which you are referring I will continue to miss them

Why because Ive hacked your platform by learning which rides a few mentioned here pay less than minimum wage so I can intentionally miss those ride requests and instead cherry pick those which pay more

Like for example last night I got a ping to go to the Greyhound bus depot only to receive a Uber ping for the airport Guess which one became a missed ride requestI of course missed the request to go to the bus depot because I never get tips from there in contract to the airport which are longer rides with tips

I accepted a request from a drunken gentleman last night who wanted me to break down and load his bike into my carwhich elicited a cancellation from me I dont do bikes and avoid drunks in my car because theyve thrown up in theremy next stop was a high end cocktail bar where I picked up a couple who gave them a  ride and received a  tip I hacked your system to make  in  mins that included driving to the drunken the bicyclist  canceling his ride If I had done the Greyhound bus and the drunk bicyclist I would have make less than a  of that or less

So you see no I dont need a break so kind of you to inquire but ratherI just need to cherrypick the low stresslow risk high profit rides out of an otherwise rotten bunch And yes this will continue until you realize you cant cajole me into becoming an ant and deactivate me OR change your service delivery model

You have asked if Im there for paxand Id answer the question with a question asking if you Lyft are there for me to be there for pax

If you sincerely have an interest in making your platform run smoothly there are a number of ways you could reconfigure Lyft for the betterment of the community

First of all you could peg a drivers wait time to  a min Rest assured Id gladly do multistops and wait in the car as long as needed Secondly you could up the minimum fare to  This might entice me to stop in and pick up at the grocery store to drive pax one mile back home

Orif you are suggesting drivers offer social welfare servicesyou could simply have a  c  non profit arm where you welcome us to volunteer x amount of their time to render services at low cost or even no costthat way I could drive a pax from the homeless shelter to the clinic and know that Im doing it simply to contribute to society not necessarily in it for the money

This might not solve all the issues between pax ie your community and mebut it would go a long way to providing more dependable services at least from me and would keep your platform running more smoothly

"So Im working New Years Eve after I did magic at a restaurant around  am and was in Lincoln Park IL I was listening in on their conversation and I heard the guy say to his wife Our  bottle of wine was better than their so called  bottle of wine dont you think dear So I overheard them discuss the wine smoothness flavor etc etc And I chimed in

me It seems you know quite a bit about fine wines I cant tell because I am sort of allergic to alcohol I heard that paying so much for a bottle really makes a difference right

him Of course it does

And then we discussed how the vintage year I had known this before is quite important even more than the age of the wine I shared with him that just because a wine is old does not mean that it is great because the year the wine was produced could have been a bad year for grapes He agreed and shared with me that  will be an awful year for wines in California because of the fires To make a long story short he and his wife always bought extremely expensive wines to drink all the time And their budget for just wine is more than most make in a week

As I drove to a high rise in downtown Chicago he and his wife shared with me that they used to go out and eat on most days before the pandemic and always have breakfast lunch and dinner delivered since the pandemic closed many of the restaurants He and his wife did share that they still often do go out because many restaurants will break the rules and allow in door dining for patrons who they know well

The wife then warned me that if I go out to dinner with any girl to not take them to Sephia She said it was a tasting  course place in Chicago and cost about  per person BEFORE the wine which obviously they must have so they spent  last they dined there

He and his wife then told me I should go to a restaurant which I think was Everest in Chicago They told me that it costs them over  per meal there but said it is so worth it The wife said that there customer service is so good that they have a person standing right behind you at all times and the second you need to use the restroom he pulls out the chair the moment your butt leaves it Then they change the table settings of course

We discussed a bit of their vacation habits and I wont go into further details but it was all over the country and world He said he was in Florida and now in Chicago and will be moving to Wisconsin next year So I asked him

me  Let me guess you are in a field of medicine Because he was moving around the country

him Yes Facial Plastics and ENT My wife is in the field of oncology

me I know that is an incredibly lucrative field as if yours to the wife Now I know why you both can afford to go out so much and buy only the most expensive drinks

him Yes do you know about the field of medicine You seem very smart

I then told him about how I went to medical school but quit and went into the financial world and do magic teach physics and do magic on the side

him Do you have any tricks with you

me Ill show you at the end of the ride

I did the following trick minus the suitcase because it would be impractical to open my trunk at the end He was so surprised and loved it and his wife yelled out an expletive It was a trick where I take a stack of one dollar bills then change them into s This was the trick I always tailor the magic to the passenger I knew he and his wife would love anything to do with money


I posted this story because I am reminded that even during times when people are about to be kicked out of their homes because they cant pay rent or their mortgage others literally are swimming in money So of sad

Also just to add even with the magic tricks I showed two more he and his wife left no tip",0.9816,0.037,0.891,0.072,Positive,0.1,0.02,0.33,0.26,0.29,2021,Young Kim
"I wanted to post the story because I thought it was so interesting Last night one of my passengers was coming from his apartment to the target by lincolnwood illinois for his overnight shift I started the conversation by mentioning how target treats their employees very well because I heard theyre giving good hazard pay

He replied that they are and that theyre hiring now at his store in case I wanted to apply We then talked about how during the holidays everybodys around family and I asked him if he was excited to be around his family He told me he was from st Louis and he will only be spending it with his roommates

So then I asked him if he will see his family on zoom He replied that he would only see his sister and his niece on zoom So then of course I naturally asked about his parents There was a long pause He reply that he hasnt seen his parents since he was  years old and hes  years old now

I gauged how he looked in the rear view mirrorand then I just asked gently could I ask why you havent seen him in so long are they still alive

He then asked in a funny way is this taxi cab confession or a  hour psychology therapy session I replied that it was not and he felt uncomfortable sharing he doesnt have to

After a long pause he said well I guess ill tell you because I wont ever see you again for the rest of my life And this is something that I wanted to tell my coworkers but I cant

What he told me is that he is irish and usually irish people are so close familywise But both of his parents were serious drug addicts who abused him mentally and physically Shortly after he ran away from home at age  his sister ran away from home too He said he has no plans to ever see his parents again and cannot forgive them for what they did to him 

After he ran away from home he worked odd jobs and stayed at friends homes hes very proud of what he has accomplished even though hes never gone to college I wanted to share the story because its very surprising that people will share their most intimate life secrets with their Uber drivers",0.9635,0.045,0.854,0.1,Positive,0.09,0.11,0.23,0.18,0.38,2020,Young Kim
"Saturday night I picked up a PAX and in our discussions he tells me he needs a Uber to the Airport at  Sunday morning I tell Ill be up and hopefully I get the ping I like those Sunday morning airport trips

Get up at  Sunday morning and check the rider app No drivers online yet I turn the app on at  AM I head out the door as I want to pick up something for Breakfast Before I get to my car I get the ping for a scheduled ride I see the pickup point is where I dropped the guy off and it is a  minute trip Scheduled time  to  leaves me enough time to get breakfast plus will insure I get the MAX long pickup fee

Less than a mile from my house I my app beeps and that dreaded there was a problem message pops up on the screen I knew right away Uber was screwing me out of this trip Sure enough trip was gone Another  seconds go by and I get a ping for another rider He was closer but still a long pickup I grab breakfast and head to pick them up Had to make sure I got the most out of the long pickup fee His drop off was  mile from my house Okay that works

 minute after starting the trip I get another ping the scheduled ride that they gave me before At this point there is no way I will be to the scheduled ride by  as I have an  minute trip for the ride I just picked up and a  minute ride after that to the second pickup

About  minutes into the first trip I get another ping request for the same scheduled trip I already accepted as a stacked ping Im thinking what the heck

Ended up getting to the second pickup at  am  minutes after the scheduled pickup time

Rider is a little pissed off at this point Says he saw me accept his ride He got a there was an error message on his screen and I was gone and he got driver unavailable searching After a while he got me as his driver again He than got an update message from Uber that he has a different driver a lady names Carla About  seconds later he gets the there was an error message again Searching for driver Than I show up as his driver again

I explained what happened on my end and we surmised that Uber put him on hold while they had me complete the other trip first since no other drivers came online they gave me his trip again after I started the other trip At some point Carla came online and they gave her the trip taking it from me without me knowing as I was doing another trip still Carla must have cancelled right away so now the trip came back to me

In the Driving Preferences on the Uber APP I have Trip Swaps turned off I guess Uber just uses the were sorry there was a problem message to do what they want

I got the guy to the airport on time he was very thankful and ended up dropping me a nice tip later that night",-0.8446,0.069,0.878,0.052,Negative,0.06,0.06,0.28,0.15,0.45,2021,FLKeys

Most of the students enrolled at Lynhurst Baptist Church Preschool in Indianapolis are children of parents who have worked as essential workers pandemic and nearly all are from families that fall at or below the poverty line according to the preschools director Renee Dixon

And all  of the preschools students plus their siblings received Christmas presents this year thanks to Dixon who has spent her weeknights and weekends for the past year as an  and Lyft driver in order to make extra money to buy them gifts

Dixon who lost three of her own family members to COVID said enrollment at the school which serves kids ages  to  dropped in half during the pandemic as students parents lost their jobs She also had difficulty finding work as an Uber driver due to decreased demand so she signed up as a driver with Lyft too picking up rides whenever and wherever she could

We are thrilled to see her heartfelt story getting national attention particularly during a very challenging year a Lyft spokeswoman told GMA in a statement Lyft was originally created to help build and support communities through transportation so it is wonderful to see people like Renee take that spirit one step further for her students and their families

When Dixon earned  from her driving she headed to Target to buy not only toys and games for her students but also essential items like winter clothing Faced with decreased earnings from Uber and Lyft Dixon said she also took money from her own paycheck to buy items for her students

This year with COVID and everything that has really been taken away from the kids at no fault of their own I had to do something said Dixon whose story was  The location of where the school is its not in the best neighborhood but we make the best out of everything

Even with the odds stacked against her Dixon said as of last week she was able to raise over  this year to spend on her students",-0.7264,0.066,0.873,0.061,Negative,0.06,0.06,0.38,0.19,0.31,2021,goneubering

"I picked up a guy named ar by franklin park illinois I took him for a  minute drive all the way to the south side of Chicago he said by englewood The screenshot I took was about  minutes into the ride right before I enter the eisenhower But on my map it says something slightly different His story was was that he was the father of five He is only  years old though He has the children with multiple baby mamas

I asked him what he did to support them and he said he does not have a job but just sells drugs He had been in jail before the last time was for armed robbery he did  months He said that he has posttraumatic stress disorder and depression

when I asked him why he said that because he saw his younger brother and his best friend get shot right in front of him His best friend was shot once in the head and two times the neck His brother was shot in the back and in the head he has also been shot multiple times the last time they missed and shot him through his ankle He was wearing a cast where he had ostensibly been shot On his right arm

He said that both were killed not because they had done anything really serious like kill someone directly Or steal drugs or money or rat out someone Rather they were just pawns in another multiple scoring side game series He said they are almost like teams on the NBA in Chicago Theres so many active games going on but of course the object is not just for baskets but rather for people


He said that and he used the words is kind of like a game of ping pong out here in the south and the west side of chicago He said its kind of like a game of chess as well When one person takes a piece on one side the other person tries to take a piece on the opposing side And there are sacrifices on both sides

I thought that most of the killings would be drug related but he said thats not the case He said that many killings are part of a larger game going on and a larger war where multiple battles go on in different areas Where the object is just to knock out as many people on the opposing side and you sacrifice some of your own members to get to the higher level members

He said that often the killing is almost on a whim He said that if you have a friend and somebody scored  on one of his other friends and was  blocked then you have an obligation to help him carry out a hit He said that if youve just met someone then of course you wouldnt carry on a hit but if you became good friends and there was a score to settle then you would sort of have to join in

He said that it is literally an active war zone and theres so many different battles going on at once I asked him how many games there were and he said theyre just too numerous to count

He didnt say that theres any specific areas that are more dangerous than another He said that you have to keep on monitoring who is on any particular corner at any given time if you go to a corner where theres someone trying to score on your team  Which means someones trying to kill someone on your team then you have to avoid that area One score means that you killed somebody on the opposing team and a block means that instead of getting killed you were able to get at least one shot off onto the other person

He said that after three successful blocks the person trying to score on you must by street principal avoid trying to kill you for at least one week They can try again after week but then there has to be some kind of majority vote On who can volley for the next attempted score

He does not talk to his father as his father has been in jail for most of his life But he does have year goals which I asked about He wants to move out of his grandmothers house and he wants to get a job as a busboy at olive garden

well I told him that I drive sometimes on the south of the west side and Ive never had any problem he was not surprised he said that if you mind your own business and dont wear any fancy jewelry or drive a fancy car then in Chicago street principle everyone is supposed to leave you alone If someone were to inflict serious harm to someone like me who is an outsider then said that other members would actively hunt that person down because I am not actively participating in any active street game He said that now that he knows me he said I would be protected on certain areas participates in He was Telling other members that he was talking to on his team about me and my car and then I was protected from now on He said that he is part of a rather large group connected to other groups and they would get the word out

I asked him how hard it is to get a gun and he said that its so easy that if I wanted one tonight and had a little bit of money I could just pick one up from him

Of course I dont feel any safer After I dropped him off I logged off and Im back in downtown right now Common sense is of course id rather be in downtown but I do not actively avoid the south of the west side either

I found this interesting because it was quite complicated and the killings and the settlings of different activities take place sometimes over many years

"I drive in a medium sized metropolitan area in California Not a big city Crime is relatively low Smallish homeless population The few protests that occurred this year were peaceful Nonetheless for several years now across the board Ive noticed that people are becoming edgier more stressed out more angst ridden People already on the edge have been falling off it

But in the past few months even in the typically docile communities I traverse in my rideshare car I am witnessing events Ive only ever seen on TV Take for example a recent morning run to McDonalds for morning coffee which ended up in a showdown not dissimilar to the Seinfeld episode where George and another driver both claim the same parking space on a New York street The drivethrough has two ordering lanes which converge to a single lane While placing my order in lane  an SUV abruptly pulls in to lane  and starts ordering We both pull forward to the single lane to make payment around the same time but I end up slightly ahead of the other driver Still he edges his vehicle close to the car in front of us waiting to pay I am feeling a bit anxious myself and refuse to give any ground The Lane  driver has his right window down Conversation ensues

Me I was ahead of you sir
Lane  guy No I was already ahead of you and in line
Me No you werent
Lane  guy Repeats his claim and pulls his car forward another foot
Me OK You win Go ahead and go I back up a few feet
Lane  guy He mouths off some more even though he had won I dont recall the exact words
Me Go ahead Clearly its important to you to go first
Lane  guy Well clearly its important to you too
Me But its clearly  important to you

With that last sentence I have achieved a verbal technical knockout The driver knows this and is so frustrated by it that he exits his vehicle and starts heading to my car announcing in a threatening voice Oh you got something to say I am of course trapped in the drivethrough line with no escape I am of retirement age and this guy is half my age twice as big and grossly overweight

I roll the window part way up Then with my left hand I retrieve the can of pepper spray from the door pocket and grab my phone with the other hand I shout out Get back in your car fatso or Ill mace you and call 

The guy collects his senses and retreats to his car Now the pay window is clear for us to pull forward I announce to the other driver Im  going to let you go ahead He pulled ahead infuriated Later when I pulled in to traffic and got caught at the first red light there was the guy again nearly next to me He didnt see me though and as the light turned green he was on his horn for the guy in front of him who wasnt moving fast enough to suit him


In another incident I was driving on a two lane road that necked down to one lane after an intersection Traffic was heavy but moving with the green light As I crossed the intersection suddenly a big diesel pickup door duallies lunges forward from the cross street which had the red light The truck turns right and is now parallel to me in what is the merge lane just before the road becomes  lane The driver is flooring it and you can hear the loud diesel laboring under the load

I choose to give no ground I am admittedly stubborn at times thinking that as the roadway gets narrower and narrower the driver will eventually back off But noooooooo He keeps moving to the left until finally I have no choice but to either let him hit me or give up the lane I was forced out of the lane and into one of those center type lanes that allow vehicles driving in either direction to make a left turn I then eased in behind the giant truck

After about a mile the pickup turns off on a side street I was still pissed off enough that I decided to follow it and get a shot of the license plate to report the driver to the police for reckless driving Big mistake In short order the driver pulls over to a curb I do likewise about four car lengths back Im thinking the guy is going into a nearby business But noooo Out pops the driver and heading straight for me The dude is MASSIVE The word monster actually popped into my mind He was nearly as big as his truck Giant bald head You know the type Except in this case his head sort of narrowed at the top and came to a crown Like he was deformed or something Kind of like the extrawide version of Zippy the pinhead

Walking toward my car in a bellowing voice he shouts out Do you have something to say  I was so scared I sort of froze Wasnt even thinking about the pepper spray which easily could have easily backfired anyway Like shooting a  at a Grizzly bear and simply pissing it off The only thing I could think of was to act like I was photographing him and the truck Maybe fear of the incident being documented would make him back off It didnt Worse yet I couldnt find the camera icon on the stupid phone so I was just pretending to photograph him and his truck The dude came right up to my fully closed window I ignored him steadfastly pretending to photograph the scene In frustration he slammed his fist against the drivers window and walked back to his truck My whole car shook from the single fist pound Why the glass didnt break I do not know


There have been other unusual overthetop vehicle incidents lately as well But all the other ones Ive just backed away from In greater numbers people are losing their senses at times And you simply cant argue with a crazy person

Finally there was this vehicle parked in a CVS parking lot

"So toward the end of the night around  am saturday night I was in evanston and picked up a lady with a suitcase I knew that of course shes going to OHare airport She was very talkative and told me that she wants to tell me a story of true love

She said that shes reconnecting with someone that shes loved for  years She said that back when she was just a teenager she went on a date with this guy named larry in high school Both of them were so shy back then that they didnt know how to spark anything up 

Anyway years past and he got married and she married some lawyer They had three children She said the first  years of the marriage were good but after that it fell apart as he got verbally abusive Then later she found out that he was hiring prostitutes for many many years She found this out because he accidentally called her phone and left a voicemail talking to one of the call girls that he was regularly seeing She said she wanted to stick to her wedding vows and also for children so she still stayed in the marriage

Then  years ago her husband was diagnosed with ALS It progress rapidly She stayed back from her job to take care of him during his final years But in february of  she was in jewel and she sent a random text to larry who was still an old friend of hers over the years 

Larry replied to her that hes in the midst of getting a divorce She informed larry that her husband is in the terminal stages of ALS and doesnt have long to live So in february of  he said that hes coming to chicago to visit a friend as soon as she met him in his hotel room she said there was an instant connection and it was like she met her twin flame in this life They made love that night and the following night She said that it was dynamite and it was the best sex she ever had 

Shes then saw him in april then in june then in july and then in september In september of this year is when her husband finally passed away She confessed to me even though she fell slightly guilty about it that she was finally relieved that her husband had passed It was hard taking care of someone with that disease but she wanted to stay true to the promise of taking care of him till the end

however her children were very angry at her for having an affair while their father was still alive But in her mind she felt that why should she feel not feel bad because the marriage had been ostensibly over  years ago when they were no longer in love And the fact that she knew that he was having affairs himself with multiple prostitutes over decades Made it easier to have the affairs because she knew that her husband was going to die anyway very soon

I did not judge her but during the long ride to OHare from evanston illinois I showed her a couple of my magic tricks on my phone She was so amazed and she said that she wanted my phone number so that she could invite me for her friends or for childrens parties of parents that she knows I said fine and I texted her my number 

Then later before we left she said that if she was not meeting larry that she would have loved to gone on a date with me As we left the ride she asked me that when she comes back in a week if we could have coffee

She was  years old and she had a very nice figure skinny but I told her that theres no way I would do anything that might compromise her new relationship with larry I dont think that it was a romantic gesture but rather because she felt that we had such a strong connection Anyway we ended the ride very pleasantly and I wished her well and she said that she would keep in touch with me about what happens After a few minutes I started getting texts with her though however

I just replied that I hope this thing with larry goes well and that you both get married I thought it was a fastening love story that after  years her who was named michelle and this new guy larry could be kindle their  year old gap where they knew that they loved each other all along I did tell her that sometimes this kind of true love does last or take a very long time in this case for her  years but I wish her well and I hope that this new relationship completely works out And I told her that her children should be understanding and forgive her and be happy for her",0.9993,0.035,0.783,0.182,Positive,0.17,0.1,0.29,0.15,0.29,2020,Young Kim

Now some of them I can understand but my philosophy is if you accept the trip you should keep it Maybe a  minute window to cancel but it is about customer service You cancel now I have to deal with a pissed off pax and try to calm them down else I get YOUR  

Last night one of my last trips of the night  mile to pickup  mile trip drop off was a mile from my house SWEET

"I dont want to be negative in the Holiday Seasons That is not my intent Many of you work Uber because you have nothing Many of you work Uber because you are unempolyable Many work Uber because they are social outcasts Many work Uber because they are lazy Many work Uber because they dont have the ambition to do something else or the ability to use their brains to find something Like I said I dont want to be negative and emphasize these type of problems I dont even want to mention them

Thing is if you dont do anything things only get worst Waiting for a miracle is silly I keep hearing people say Thank God  is over or I am so happy  is finally over I merely ask a simple question Why Why is it good  is over What makes you think  will get better Why couldnt  be even worse

The only way to better yourself starts with yourself Dont depend on others You need to be the one that finds their way out of the trap I hope with the Holiday Season you are all going back to school or starting school or starting a apprenticeship or you are starting a job in something that you can get skilled or educated in something marketable or you are getting certified or licensed in something in demand

" WARNING  buzz killer post 

Drove passengers for the first time in weeks this afternoon People were driving like maniacs as has been the case since the protests  cops seem to have mainly thrown in the towel around here 

Was driving on I saw a major collision on the opposite lane Less than half a mile away came up on a multi vehicle collision with an obvious fatality that had happened within minutes before 

Had a passenger felt powerless Wanted to stop Saw this poor elderly man dead and who knows about the other car crashed in the median on the other side of the road 

If not for me missing a turn because my pax was back seat driving I would have likely been in the middle of this Today wasnt my day or my pax Saw several other minor accidents heading home driving carefully as I could 

Always tell your loved ones that you love them before you leave I always kiss my pup and tell my wife I love her even if shes pissed at me for something SLOW DOWN and please be careful

"I was driving near Golf Rd and Waukegan Rd around Morton Grove IL when I got a ping request for UberEats around  payout at a place called Wings and Things on the app It is a low offer but I saw that the pickup was only  minute away and the dropoff was just  minutes down the street When I accepted I immediately got a second ping from the same location It was for  so I also accepted that When I pulled into the parking lot I could not find the name on the store window but saw an open restaurant with the lights on I confirmed the address number even though it was not the actual name on the front I called out as there was nobody behind the counter After awhile a guy came out I told him the two names on the order a Dani and a George

I am usually very friendly with my greeting but this guy sort of ignored it and seemed like he was in a very bad mood I recognized him from earlier deliveries and recalled his unfriendly nature He curtly said that George was ready but Dani the  dollar order would be  minutes I then very nicely explained to him that the Dani order was a  dollar order and since it is not ready and the second one was on the counter and was a  dollar order that maybe I should cancel that order and allow another driver to take it when the food is ready

I very kindly told him My friend if the  order can be ready in  minutes then I can wait But if you think it will take  minutes or more then maybe I will cancel and let another driver take it because it may not be worth it for me to wait

Then he surprised me with the following words

He abruptly said I really dont care if you take either order because I get paid either way When I click on the accept button then I get paid If you cancel I dont care because I get paid no matter what

and then the following words REALLY pissed me off

He continued on in a proud entitled way I want you to know that I really dont care at all what  make in tips Because I get paidso whether you make nothing or something 

The reason why this last sentence really upset me is that he was so demeaning to all delivery drivers He was not just targeting me but  He acted so proud as if we delivery drivers were so unimportant to him and what we got paid because he would be paid regardless And he said it in such a rude manner You had to be there to understand it

I was surely going to cancelbut I remembered reading here on someone elses post that in fact what he said was true that the restaurant gets paid by Uber whether the delivery is made or not So I politely said OK if it will be a short while then Ill wait and I smiled In retrospect I should have just cancelled probably but I was already there and in the back of my mind I wanted to let him know that I was a patient person and a polite person After about  minutes he came out with the food At this point I calmed down a little but I tried to explain to him and this is where many of you may disagree with me because I confronted him that his words I want you to know that I really dont care at all what you guys make in tips Because I get paidso whether you make nothing or something I dont care was rather mean and insensitive

I said to him Respectfully sir I wish to tell you that I was not blaming you at all that the food was not ready or that the customer did not leave a decent tip but rather the reasons why I may have wanted to cancel the order that was not ready I thought what you said about delivery drivers in general and how you dont care what we get paid is mean and actually rude

But suddenly he raised his voice and got all defensive and spoke down to me in an insulting fashion Look you are not supposed to even tell me what you are getting paid That is not your job You guys job is just to come inside not say anything get the food and leave

I realized I was almost to lose my cool I took a deep breath and said OK thanks Goodnight and I wish you well and please understa

I could not finish my sentence because he just walked away out of sight behind a wall

Surely if I ever get this location again I will reject the order But I really had a passing thought of wanting to smack him I recall I even clenched my fist for a moment He was behind the counter in a very drab sort of beat up fast food restaurant with no seating Why would he act so proud and mighty and say rude and insensitive things to me and about all delivery drivers He targeted all UE and DD drivers by saying I don care what you guys make I get paid anyway I did not act angry that the food was not ready or that the customers tip was lousy I only tried to explain to him the reasons why I did not want to wait for the second order indicating that for a tiny payout it may not be worth it if I had to wait a long time

I am certain that other drivers have had similar experiences I wish that Uber did not pay out the restaurant immediately like this Then if I could cancel I may feel that if the food is not delivered then he would be affected But if he is paid the instant he clicks accept then maybe this is why he acts this way to delivery drivers

I did thumb down the delivery and gave a reason unprofessional staff I also called UberEats support on my way to the second order and complained The rep took down my information and said she would forward it on I tried to find the place again just now through Google to write a negative review to describe what happened to me but the restaurant name was not even on the search when I typed in the name I recall on the app I do recall the second order at the exact same location even had a different name for the restaurant It was two words Future and then another word Since the orders are done I cannot contact an UE support rep live to find the name of the restaurant

Would you have been as incensed and pissed off as I was I was disappointed because he acted so high and mighty and dismissive even though I was so polite and said and did absolutely nothing to provoke him or accuse him of anything It would be a different matter if I was rude to him first in retrospect I think that in his infantile world he thought that when I said I may cancel the order if the wait is too long then I am warning him that if he does not produce the food soon that he wont get paid I think that was what he thought so he would prove his superior position by stating that he could not care if I did so because he is already paid But I did nothing to suggest that At all

"Long story short

The shop I get my rental cab from also has a chauffeur business on the same business model more or less Aside from booked chauffeur fares they are also on the Uber platform

This morning I was talking to one of the chauffeurs and told me that he got deactivated off Uber for a bullshit face mask complaint

In the middle of the ride he asked the customer to put her face mask back on then she accused him of not wearing a mask while driving her This lead to him losing access to Uber

Dude that sucks your not in trouble with Mears over that are you

No this was a month ago and they just gave me a copy company lingo for chauffeur fares driving one of the execs today so Im sure Im fine

Makes me feel better about my Uber rating I tell him

my friend eventually everyone gets false complaints Dont worry about Uber eventually well all get kicked off Ive been at Mears for  years and driving VIPs for  But Im still dream team so dont worry about Uber at all

wait your one of the guys who gets the Saudi princes and whoever I ask

He just chuckled at me and nodded

Yeah the guy who has been doing this for  years and is trusted with Saudi Princes gets a false accusation just because he politely asked her to put her face mask back on

more talking later and he said that he only picks up a car on days that they have chauffeur business for him to do I looked over his shoulder and recognized the name of his clipboard of his customer

"I want to share these  deliveries which did not have a good start but ended sweetly

Can you people really shuffle food these days I thought I could with this one after making  futile attempts in calling the customer It was a  order from a pizzeria that could translate to my dinner that night and also feeding me the following day What is the logic of the minute timer if drivers cannot keep the food Not advocating for shuffling here but dont we deserve to be compensated for the waiting time

As what you would expect from Lyft Postmate also loves to sneak in an offer without notifying us At first I thought it was not a big deal because the drop off location was added along the route Not until I slided the complete pick up button it was too late to realize the possibility of scam due to the red flags of teen and his message I dont want my parents to know




Days after the failure to shuffle the pizza and Lasagna bolognese the customer tipped me decently




To my surprise that underage customer also tipped me  weeks after the delivery I am certain that he did tip because the  tip from the first delivery showed up the same evening However I still do not have any faith in the younger generations Keeping the photo I took at his front door and also a selfie video showing I walked back to my car empty will become extremely useful should one day his boredom provokes him to do something dirty

"It has been almost a year now One evening around  pm I got a ping with a males name I drove to the pick up point and wait a couple minutes and I saw a teen couple coming out When they reached to my car the boy opened the door for this girl She got in and sat then they were exchanging a few words I realized that the account owner requested Uber for the girl and it was  mins ride After they said see you later I drove off and trying make a U turn as we were going to Oakland West Bart station After  feet from pick up point I noticed that this girl started crying silently I was being silent and waited for a few minutes but she didnt stop her silent crying then I asked Is there something wrong Honey Then she started crying out

As we were heading to Oakland she told me her story She is  and just gave a birth with that boy She had no job Her mother kicked her out of her house but kept the baby She had asked help from police but they delivered her to a hospital That day she was discharged from hospital and tried reach to her boyfriend father of her baby That boy was living with her mom and still in school had part time job Her boyfriend also didnt accept her to give temporary shelter as well She had been her boyfriends house since morning and seemed he tried to kick her out before his mom came back from work So she was going to Bart station and hoping to get connected her friends

It was a really sad story of her I was trying to encourage her to call her mom and beg I tried several times to call her mom She refused and cried cried She told me I dont know her mom but I know how a parent would be worrying about their run away kid She didnt give me her mothers contact number so I have no choice but to send her to her destination As it was getting dark and because of her weak plan I asked her if she had done her dinner She said No I asked if she was hungry and she said she was starving That bastard of her boyfriend didnt even offer her a meal the whole day So I decided to buy her dinner so she wont be hungry the whole night I told her that I would buy her something to eat but we had to finished the ride first at destination And told her to let her boyfriend know She said her phone was not in service and she would only have wifi to connect when she got free wifi spot Alright then let it be

As I finished the ride I asked her what she would like to eat Chinese Pizza Burger whatever I would want to fill up your stomach full for the night so she wouldnt be hungry before she found help This poor girl just choose McDonalds burger I felt sad She didnt want to use my money too much As per her choice I drove to McDonalds and let her order her burger at drive through She did order just one burger I told her it wont be enough and should order more burger She refused my offer Then I told clerk to add meal with the burger and make it two burger And I drove her off at her destination Oakland Bart station Again She would enjoy her food there

At the drop off as she got out I got out off the car as well I wanted to give her a good luck hug but I didnt I didnt want to make physical contact to my expax because of RS policy So I could just wish her good luck and gave her Obamas famous word for strength  You can do it

I hope she is doing well right now She will never forget about an Asian guy was trying to help her
As I left I cursed her boyfriend really bad Because of him she was pregnant and gave birth Because of that she was kicked out from her house That MF didnt try to give her shelter or didnt try to help her out with some money The worst was he didnt even offer her a meal the whole day and for night Men who dont have responsible manner are really disgusting",-0.1028,0.105,0.783,0.112,Negative,0.09,0.06,0.21,0.22,0.42,2020,Wildgoose

"A few weeks ago I had an incident after I accepted an Uber X trip that turned out to be actually transporting a contaminated inflatable hospital bed from one nursing home to another

I was promised a tip in exchange for this it was pretty clear that I was shafted I was pissed so I followed up apparently my email correspondence ended up going to the account holder and he unsuccessfully attempted to get me deactivated

That thread is here  Thread Transported an air mattress and I will tip you in the app 

That situation along with horrible pings for pax and non tipping on delivery made me decide to 

Thread Working on my exit 

In between online programming courses I came across these videos on YouTube




So she was doing Doordash for two whole weeks A customer pulled a scam what a surprise and instead of calling Doordash she decided that the best idea was to return to the customer and confront her while recording on her phone

She then doxed the customer I did not to the point that the pharmacy had to disable reviews on Google And in the first linked video there is a link to send her money

Key lessons 

 If you are doing deliveries regardless of the platform call support immediately if you are accused of not delivering the order A friend of mine recently had this happen I encouraged him to call Uber and he did But he decided to quit after being threatened with deactivation

 If you are pissed off let it go  especially if your first idea is to point your phone in the customers face and put it on YouTube Yes I posted a video here ages ago of a bad pax It was not a public video I blurred his face and I later deleted it Bad idea all around

 Doordash sucks they can keep their stupid Red Card and buggy app  thats just my opinion ",-0.9062,0.11,0.809,0.08,Negative,0.05,0.14,0.2,0.32,0.3,2020,Benjamin M
"I had just pickedup a delivery order from an outdoor shopping mall and was leaving the place when this incident took place I had pulled out of the shopping center and came up on a streetlight with a crosswalk The light was turning orange so I slowed to stop for it 

As I was coming to a stop this woman appeared in the crosswalk and I had to give the brakes a somewhat hard stop because I didnt want to risk coming too close to her in the crosswalk She had not even turned her head to look for cars when she stepped into the street  She seemingly appeared out of no where 

I stopped in time so It should not of been an issue  but this woman was clearly enraged that I had to hard stop  feet before the crosswalk 

She appeared to be in her mid s dressed in scrubs  big face diaper on carrying some shopping bags from the various upscale stores there She turned to me and gave this crazed look 

At this point I pointed to my eyes and then started to mime like I was walking in place  Basically I was trying to say look for cars when your walkingI did this more in a comical way because I already felt she was over reacting  

Thats when the events turned nuts She stormed up to my car window  Now try to imagine a horror movie where the maniac is suddenly staring at you inches from your face  eyes bugging out like a crazy person  That damn mask  in my face You guys know how I feel about the masks 

I calmly roll my window down and turn my head to her She is still bugging like shes going to punch me I calmly told her she should at least turn her head before marching into the street so she doesnt get hit by a car that doesnt see her I thought I was being logical 

Whelp she started screaming under her mask that shes a pedestrian and its a crosswalk I agreed however I stopped  feet before it so GET THE F AWAY FROM ME  I yelled back Thats when things became violent  

She became UNHINGED and started high stepping my car door  repeatedly kicking it  This is my new car I owe k on btw I threw my car in park  fumbled with the door lock  finally got the door open before about the rd kick to my door She was midkick when I opened it  so she fell back on the street  

I was close to losing my temper but I was well aware that she was a woman and I dont punch kick  slap or stomp women However I will protect myself and my property the best I can bring a civilian with no training on how to do so  

I was furious at her for putting me in this situation and damaging my car I bent down and ripped her shopping bags from her hands  My thought was Ill throw these as far as I can into the street as payback and hopefully shell go chase them and I can escape Well thats not how it went 

Firstly  small bags of clothes dont throw very far It was like trying to throw a feather The bags only landed like  feet away  As I turned to jump into my car and split she jumps up and tries to get in my car before I do 

She was almost all the way in my driver side as a grabbed her by the back of her head and peeled out off my my car and just kind of threw her away from the car 

Now she is playing the victim and started screaming for help  Im just trying to get away at this point I was just about to shut my driver door when like the Terminator she jumps back up dives into my driver side window  which is still rolled down from earlier  Im now in a horror movie Night if the Living Covidiot Thats the only way I can describe it 

She knocked my side view mirror backwards and is now clinging on to my door bending it down  I was wondering why my car wasnt moving only revving in place  the emergency brake was on  I calmly told her  let go of my car let go of my car  let go of my carshe screams No I then popped the ebreak and punched it She flew off  I bailed  What the F just happened Holy shit I looked in my rear view and there were like  cars behind me Im assuming jail is coming for me 

I called my girlfriend and told her what happened  I got her phone number and wrote it on my arm  No one remembers phone numbers anymore  Now the funny part is  I actually delivered the  order I picked up so I wouldnt lose access to the app  I then headed toward home when a local number called me  I answered 

Who is it THE POLICE DEPARTMENT  
My life is overor is it

He says Hi Oside Uber Do you mind coming back to the scene where the women attacked you We have her here in the police car  I was very calm and compliant  I let him know I was  minutes away and headed back over there 

I show up and theres like  cop suburbans Ks About  cops standing around  No ambulances luckily He checked the damage to my car and got my statement  They seemed to be holding back laughter over it all He assured me no one was in trouble I told him I didnt intend to press charges He kind of laughed and said he didnt think I would  I consider myself lucky she didnt get hurt  

Im sure the Dudley DoRights on here will rip me a new one for getting into an altercation with a female  but you never expect these incidents when they happen  

Everyone is stressed out My car door has a nice dent in the bottom of it but I was able to bend the door back up so I closes properly  Go ahead tell me how YOU wouldve handled my situation ",-0.9187,0.112,0.789,0.099,Negative,0.09,0.12,0.29,0.22,0.28,2020,O-Side Uber

"This just happened about  minutes ago

I have done well over k rides total on lyft and uber combined I am cool with almost all my passengers They always thank me we usually have a nice conversation and exchange pleasantries Let me explain what just happened

I was on my way home after doing about  trips today and grossing about  I put lyft on destination mode and figured Id do one more pickup It was a young looking female with a rating of   I thought Thats pretty low I wonder why About halfway there she texts on the app asking me Can I confirm pickup which was odd I figured this must be the reason shes rated low as unnecessary texting is no doubt not only annoying to me but others as well Nonetheless I responded saying Im on the way To which she responded thanks the app is acting weird

I arrive and wait about  minutes and she comes out She mispronounces my name then apologizes and says Max will be right out I said Max oh ok I love how you act like I know him Half annoyed at the fact that she mispronounced my name and half being a smart ass

So she starts yelling at max to come out and I say Ill give him one more minute She keeps yelling for him and finally he comes out Dude gets in and says Hey buddy To which I really didnt want to respond but I wasnt trying to be too much of a dick so I gave him a disinterested Whats goin on

A minute or two later she starts saying she put in  stops one of them a taco bell drive thru I told them we dont do drive thrus She says Are you not  referring to my name Now im starting to get pissed as she damn well knows my name and is acting as if someone is my boss or overseer She persists about the taco bell drive thru even after I said I suppose I can make an exception and really pissed me off So I pulled over and said You know what you guys can get out right here

The dude says Are you serious I say yes He then says Youre a piece of shit I said excuse me He said You heard me

At this point I went from  to  in about half a second Get out of the car right now I said I get out and slam the driver door About  seconds or so later they both emerge I can see he is drunk He puts his hands up and says Im not gonna fight you I can see he is legit scared so I said Im not gonna fight you but this is ridiculous The dumbass girl is still pointing to the app and saying Arent you  blah blah referring to my name as if Ive been appointed to be her servant or something So there they are standing on the curb on the side of a road a couple miles from where I picked them up and I get in my car and drive off

It was really cold tonight Let that be a lesson to these entitled drunk idiots

That being said how would you have handled the situation Would you have gotten angry and kicked them out for acting the way they did Or do you think I overreacted When the guy called me a piece of shit for telling them to get out honestly I was ready to beat some ass Im glad the dude backed down or that could have been really bad",-0.9887,0.144,0.754,0.102,Negative,0.06,0.03,0.42,0.25,0.23,2020,Reynob Moore

"I didnt drive on Saturday night because I wined and dined my wife Olive Garden To Go so we could watch The Walking Dead at home so I did go out on drive on Sunday lately its been busy enough to turn my back on religious fulfillment and sell my soul to the Uber Devil

Anyway I get a ping at x for a  mile ride that will be about  minutes The pax had a  rating and its at a local restaurant that is pricey so I figure this will be another smooth ride

I get to the restaurant and did the usual text I have arrived

The pax responds Are you my Uber driver

Really

Me Yes
Pax Are you out front
Me Yes I have arrived
Pax Im on my way out meet me at the front please so I know its you

It was almost  minutes that passed and I get that feeling I may cancel this ride when a ish white lady comes out and stares at me and my car and her phone for almost  seconds She slowly approaches the car and I roll down the passenger window and ask Are you Maria She nods yes and again looks at her phone then at me as I unlocked the doors

Maria opens the rear passenger door

Maria Are you my Uber driver
Me Yes
Maria You are FusionLUser
Me Yes
Maria Do you have ID to show

OK I was not expecting that question at all and I was stumped on what to say I was thinking did this lady really just ask me for ID

Maria I need to see your ID
Me We dont show ID Uber has my picture car and license plate for you to verify I am your driver
Maria But you are wearing a mask How do I know its really you
Me We are not required to show our ID miss
Maria I need to see your ID to verify you are who you say you are
Me Miss Im not giving you my ID if you like you can cancel the ride
Maria I should not have to cancel the ride when you are not complying with the law by identifying yourself

This ride is over I just need her to shut my door I was going to cancel by saying the pax was a noshow but I just decided to cancel the ride

Me Miss Im not going to hand you my wallet or ID If you want to see my ID you can come to my window and look at my ID with my window closed

Maria lifts her head out of my car and before she heads to my side I channel my father and say Close the door you are letting all the cold air out and she closes the door

Doors locked Ride cancelled

When she gets behind my car I slowly pull away I contemplated letting her come up to my window so I tell her she is a complete nut job but I just decided to keep my mouth shut and move on

I just had a memorable ride I drove to a house for a pickup in the suburbs Once there I saw the garage door open and there was a lady at the back of the garage by the door in a wheelchair She called out that she needed help so I went to her and pushed her down the driveway to my car I opened the door and she told me she had cerebral palsy and would need help I gave her my hand but she said she really could not move her body well So she said she would need to put her arms around my neck and that I would have to carry her I was fine with this but since she was around the same body weight as mine it took some time The only issue I had was that as I positioned her in my back seat she sort of fell sideways and slightly hit her head on the opposite door not hard before I could put her seat belt on I put the wheelchair in as best I could I drove her to church which was four blocks away I wheeled her into the church and sat her down and positioned her carefully as Mass was starting She had no complaints and was happy but I was afraid she could have been injured while I was placing her into my car Has anyone been in a similar situation,0.8871,0.05,0.849,0.101,Positive,0.05,0.11,0.24,0.18,0.42,2020,Young Kim

When the Covid pandemic started I drove my last passenger on  March  as I have the care of a parent susceptible with underlying health conditions Nothing since

The University of California San Diego UCSD is one of the largest hospitals in the county It has an ER trauma ward and an separate outpatient entry that you can drive up to and drop someone off




Or pick them up

On the morning of Monday  August  the Wife took my vehicle to work as She had to pick up a friend of the family a patient of the hospital at the end of the day A patient losing to cancer

The Wife turns into the hospital grounds and pulls up in the loading zone in front of Out Patients She puts the vehicle in park and before She can turn the engine off the back door opens

Hi Im Jake

Wife turns around and looks Jake in the eye and says Youve got the wrong car Jake

Jake looks down at his phone and then back at my Wife

Cant you take me anyway youre an Uber

Wife calmly explains that She is not an Uber driver and asks Jake to exits the car Jake steps out and before he can close the door a woman holds the door open and asks Are you my Uber

Wife explains that She is not an Uber and gets some opposition back from the female

If youre not here for me then why are you here with the Uber signs

Wife recognizing the entitled millennium attitude prevalent in so many people says Im not your Uber and calmly presses the door lock as the woman closes the rear door

Wife pulls out her cell phone to text the patient that She is present outside the doors and that She is in my vehicle with extra leg roomand room for their wheelchair

As She is texting a second guy now the third person comes up to the front passenger door and tries to open the locked door The passenger swings their cell phone around to show Wife the passenger app and even sitting across the vehicle She can see that the passengers driver is still three minutes awayin their silver Prius

Look at your app youve got the wrong car she yells at him without unlocking the doors The male person turns the cell phone back to themselves sees the error of their ways and backs away gesturing an apology

After texting the patient Wife reports She sat for about ten minutes waiting for a response The Patients chemotherapy was wearing Him down so we knew that schedules had to be flexible During that time Wife had two more people wandering about heads down looking at their cell phone in the palm of their hand She watched as they went back and forth before approaching the vehicle and attempting to enter the rear door Neither of them walked to the driver side to approach my Wife

With time to spare waiting for the patients She presses the on board link to telephone me

Im never driving your car again

Quickly I run through the back of mind about my car Oil change not due AC recharged two weeks ago Sirius XM reprogrammed so Her favorite station is on the first list of favorites

Is there something wrong I ask

Yeah Everyone coming out of the hospital thinks Im their Uber

I look at the clock  it pm Both outpatients and business day employees are leaving I laugh and explain to her that every passenger has at least seven different pieces of information to identify their Uber including the license plate and the driver photo

She asks Then why do they keep coming up to me

Passengers are morons I deliver previously unknown information There was a young girl who failed to check her Ubers ID before getting in and unfortunately lost her life

She questions the intelligence of the Human Race by asking Are people really that stupid

People are morons I respond not missing a beat

Wife reports on the earlier passengers At this location there I is a dedicated UberLyft zone outside this hospital entrance and I ask if Shes parked in it She reports that Shes not in the zone but can see that it is about three vehicle spaces in front of her where a white Honda Accord is parked

So youre parked between the hospital doors and the Uber zone near the Vallet podium I ask

How did you know that She inquires

Id been there enough on both pick up and drop offs that I said the valet should be getting ready to go home at pm

He just walked off now She informed me

I tell her that the app has dedicated locations to pick up passengers and that that location where She is parked is where the app tells passengers their Uber is Its not where the actual pick up location is

Its thirty feet Are you telling me that people wont walk thirty feet to get into the correct Uber

People are morons I tell her again Theyre so wrapped up in themselves and oblivious to the outside world that they fail to assess the potential threats around them They will get into a car any car thinking that its their Uber because they dont consider that an Uber could be for anyone but them And if theyre really entitled when they realize their error theyll respond aggressively  as though its your fault

I hear the sound of my Wife unlocking the doors of the car followed by the sound of a door opening I hear a voice an voice unknown to me

Hi there Downtown to th Avenue please Take the  its quicker

Another passenger has entered and is giving directions I already know this is going to go bad

My Wife turns back to continue our telephone discussion and says Whats Uberspeak for Get The  Out Of My Car

I paused confused until She says Another moron just got into the car

Hey the unknown voice responds You cant speak to me like that Ill one star you

The thing about red heads having a fiery temper all true My Wife has the sweetest smile Ive ever seen but it hides a savage mouth I heard profanity raised voices and at least one threat to tear lungs out before the door closed and the vehicle was quiet for a moment

 people really are morons She said exasperated How do you do it

Not like that I said

She continues to report on the last passenger

WTF The guy just got into the white Accord and has left Your car looks nothing like an Accord

I cant take it further before the hospital staff arrive our friend in the wheelchair I stay on the phone as I listen to them load him in the car He soundsbad The Wife gets back in the car and starts it

I have the correct passenger She announces and I can hear the calmness back in her voice We hang up

"I just finished my long Saturday night shift and wished to share how every time I see  am cross my phone screen on a Saturday night I get chills A couple of years ago in August I had my most memorable painful Saturday night Ubering At  am I was picking up a passenger off the  and Fullerton in Chicago and got a call from a good friend V In a panicked voice she said S took too much heroin and was passed out V and S were dating and living together They had a one year old baby at the apartment She asked me to stop working and drive up to Lake Bluff IL to help her I told her NO Call  She refused because she was also taking heroin and didnt want the police involved I explained to her that I am in the city working Uber and the drive was  minutes north and she should call the police and ambulance

She again refused I didnt actually know their apartment address so I demanded that she call She countered with PLEASE DONT I THINK THAT S is fine but he has fallen asleep and I need you to come her and help me take care of him and told me that she thought that S had just fallen asleep and is now OK I told her to put the phone by his mouth so I could hear his breathing He seemed to be breathing fine I asked her to see if he had a pulse and she said the pulse was normal I cancelled my pickup and logged off And started to drive to Lake Bluff

After I got there I entered the apartment she opened the door and S was sitting up on the floor leaning against the couch I thought he was fine I could hear him breathing quietly So I walked up to him and said Hey bro wake up Im here now to take care of you As I touched his skin it was cold and clammy I opened his eyes and that is when I felt a chill go up my spine that cemented that moment as the  His  I immediately yelled at her to call  And she did I proceeded to give him CPR while he kept vomiting in my mouth I finally stopped once the police and ambulance arrived and they took over S had overdosed and was dying

They had found a pulse stabilized him and then left I stayed and left a statement S died three days later after being in a coma but the hospital said I kept him alive long enough for them to stabilize him and give the family hope his organs were donated Both S and V were my good friends Years ago I met them through a mutual friend I personally never had done dope never will and grimace even more whenever I hear of anyone abusing drugs One thing I realized that when she had sat him up on the couch thinking this positioning would help him it actually ended up making him choke on his own vomit She was supposed to lay him on his left side V was not arrested but she had her child taken away and went to a group home That night of doing Uber that Saturday night Now on a Saturday nightwhenever I see  am pass on my app I get a chill and pain that never goes away

"I havent been driving UBER as much Right now I cant because someone I live with could die if they get COVID so no passengers for awhile I have been doing some Eats but thankfully I was able to get another job so I dont have to rely solely on UBER I also want to say I am not above driving for a living but at times Im happy I dont have to do it so much

Some drivers solely rely on driving for a living I know it can be stressful Ive done it myself Theres good days and bad days and then theres bad passengers I remember getting in my car and one guy hadnt showered in a few days I was happy when I dropped him off I had one passenger get crazy over differences in the way we lived our lives I was happy when I dropped him off Ive had people vape in my car without asking and then try to play stupid when I said something to them about it nicely Ive had a few passengers who worried me a little and was also happy when I dropped them off However for the most part the majority of my passengers have been normal people who go from A to B and to be honest there the best customers Pick up drop off no issues they respect me and my car and were done Love to have you again anytime

However theres the bad passengers Its a whole spectrum of people who for whatever reason cant drive and need a ride somewhere but they just cant get in sit quietly and be dropped off Ive read the stories on this site and I can relate to a few of them Some passengers do drive but for whatever reason they need a ride somewhere but they just cant seem to be respectful to the driver They need to let you know that they are superior to you and try to make you feel small Or they think youre stupid or whatever is going on in their head and they just cant accept the fact they they need you to take them somewhere and be happy you are there to do that

Im a car guy I love cars always have I used to enjoy fixing mt car etc etc etc To this day I enjoy my car If youre going to get into my car respect it I keep it clean and I keep it up and Im sharing it with you I dont smoke so dont smoke in my car Dont vape dont do drugs and please eat before you request a ride or after I drop you off Ive seen the complaints from passengers and I know that some drivers have dirty cars etc etc and arent the nicest people However some of the passenger stories are just entitled garbage Drivers put high miles on their cars and make little pay Some drivers have educations and job skills that the passengers have no clue about Some of them are doing this so their family wont get evicted etc Not everyone has a smooth life think before you speak

So in conclusion and I stand by this if you dont like UBER Lyft if your Rolls Royce Limo broke down and you are just disgusted at the fact that you need to call an UBER be thankful you arent on the busIm happy to drop you at a bus stop and you can GTFO Im sure someone on the bus will want to spark up an interesting conversation with you Hopefully its about how the aliens in frying pans took their dog and raped the ducks and youre one of them and there on to you because they know you come from quack quack Seriously enjoy that Theres so many fun things about the bus but if you dont like the bus theres always cabs Cabs charge double or triple what your UBER ride would be and well you can roll the dice to see how well maintained the cab is

For whatever reason a passenger needs a ride they need to be respectful of the driver and their vehicle It should be mutual and if at the very least all you need to do is confirm who you are and where you are going and ask the driver if they are who it says on your app You can sit quietly and enjoy the scenery as it goes by and wait till you get to your destination Its just that simple if you like the service you can leave a tip we like tips if we made you happy Rideshare is so much nicer then the bus all you have to do is be nice and respectful",0.9978,0.105,0.718,0.178,Positive,0.26,0.03,0.16,0.23,0.32,2020,El Janitor

As I am loading the chair into the trunk I notice that my front passenger door is open and the small dog is standing on the seat

Umm Is the dog going with us

Oh yes yes Service dog Riiiiiight I bite my tongue but ask that they please make him stop climbing on the seat back and such Then oh sorry he training So which is it

The dog barely followed simple commands let alone advanced training to be a service animal was not on a leash none visible and did not have a vest or anything indicating it was a service animal

Then I ask the pax to sit in the back seat and put the dog on the floor Had to repeat that several times Finally oh no He more comfortable there Fine whatever

The pax managed to keep the dog between his legs on the floor during the trip I said absolutely nothing apart from asking what airline he was flying

"It has been brutally slow here lately My first hour out I made  Things were getting better around pm but I had about had it for the day

Accepted a ping and it was an odd one I was asked to transport an air mattress which was actually an inflatable hospital mattress from a nursing home rather than a pax with a promise of a big tip  trip was about  minutes

The rest is outlined below in an email Ill tip you in the app lie for this Shame on me for believing that and taking this trip although it was actually the most profitable of the day

Elazar has some explaining to do

Good evening

At  I accepted a trip request on the Uber platform Immediately after I received a message that I would be transporting an air mattress rather than a passenger sent by a gentleman named Elazar at the redactated location

Not knowing that I was to transport more than a typical air mattress but rather a large inflatable hospital mattress from a nursing facility I agreed

I hesitated to complete the trip but trips were scarce due to low demand and Elazar promised a big tip And upon dropping off the mattress taken from my trunk by staff wearing PPE he reiterated that he would tip me  and in fact said he was doing so at that very moment

As I returned to the city it became clear that I was not tipped rather was lied to in order to accept transportation of a possibly hazardous piece of medical equipment  something that is absolutely not part of the Uber platform in Richmond or delivering anything other than food

I called the redacted facility and they were apologetic and offered me a cash tip of  but by that point it was not worth the time miles tolls or effort  Elazar was the account holder and should be responsible I also called redacted and left a message

Ironically during ten years of service as a Paramedic I transported patients to and from both facilities And I expected better

UberX is not a delivery service period To then blatantly lie about compensation for such a request is reprehensible

I hope that Elazar remains true to his word perhaps inform him that drivers know if we have been tipped or not and that neither facility utilizes rideshare platforms in this manner ever again

I would appreciate to hear from management my phone number is redacted best time to reach me is after noon

Attached are details of the trip including trip summary with no tip and mention of the air mattress  tipping was mentioned on the phone audio and video recording is also available

Just then she says Is that you in the white car

Me trying to sound confused No maam it sent me over to another grocery store a couple blocks over Ill try to find you now

Thankfully since I have my mask on she couldnt see my mouth moving

I didnt ask her what was wrong but in my mind I was wondering if she would make it to the hospital alive When we arrived at the ER I got out and opened her door I offered to walk her into the hospital but she refused I stayed in the drop off zone until I saw her safely enter the hospital Then she dropped down to one knee inside the entrance A security guard quickly brought her a wheelchair so I left

"Had a pax last ride of the night pickup around Lincoln Ave and Austin Ave in Morton Grove IL Destination was a factory by OHare airport Again once I develop a solid rapport I ask gently about their lives if it seems that they wish to share She seemed totally normal affable funny and said she takes an Uber often When I asked if she drives she replied that she has gotten yes DUIs But she is still driving She cannot drive now because of an accident which totaled her car It was by a bar and she destroyed her car The car was her brothers who let her use it even though she had no drivers license After the accident she turned the corner and took off running by foot She said it did NOT involve another car so there was nobody around The next day the car was impounded and her brother took the blame and notified police He said the car was totaled and he had no phone or way to call the towing place so he walked home The pax his sister said she was drinking so that is why she fled the accident scene 

She seemed to be in her mid to late forties and said she developed a drinking problem as a teenager And one after another she got those DUIs I wished to share this because this is probably the biggest number I had heard of I have had a couple say that they got two DUIs and after the nd they learned their lesson well But she said her drinking issue was just so difficult that the problem spanned decades And naturally after the nd she started to do some jail time We both didnt think that a judge would ever let her get her license back She said that once she gets a new car she may continue to risk driving but I advised her not to Especially with her history I am worried that if she is caught driving again since she has no drivers license it may mean instant jail time 

I hoped she took my advice She had no kids or husband She was quite nice and tipped me  in cash at the end in part because I gave her a light for her cigarette that she desperately wanted to smoke before she started her shift I remember the end of the ride was funny because I accidentally drove onto a lawn instead of the roundabout where her factory door entrance was and she laughed so much and remarked that the security guard will likely tease her and me her Uber driver for making such a mistake it was hard to distinguish the grass from the driveway at the time Anyhow I was shocked that my pax didnt learn after say the second DUI I noted to myself that a lot of Uber rides at night are selected from drivers without licenses",-0.8463,0.09,0.844,0.066,Negative,0.07,0.03,0.3,0.22,0.39,2020,Young Kim

"Just sent this message to Lyft yesterday but they didnt respond and because it has now been more than  hours since I sent my message I dont think they will respond Having said that I thought I would share this with the forum as it will give most Uber  Lyft drivers with a sense of humor a good laugh as Im sure you will be able to relate to it 

ESCALATION REQUEST

Today I received an email message for Lyft indicating my driver account was flagged and that I could be deactivated due to too many cancellations I would like to respond to this message and explain some of the reasons why I cancel I hope that after a Lyft manager has had a chance to review this message that the flag will be lifted from my account

First of all Id like to point out that I have over  rides with a perfect  rating Thats a lot of rides and passengers I give rides to usually give me good ratings

Usually if a passenger has a bad experience with me its because of something they did and not me Now I dont know who has complained about me Perhaps people have complained about me because I cancelled their ride Let me explain why I do this sometimes

I would say the number one reason I cancel a ride is because the rider doesnt show up In most of these cases Ive waited  minutes or more for the passenger to show up even if they send me a message that says Im coming or Be right there In my experience usually when a passenger says Im coming or be right there what they really mean is that they are not ready and are not coming and will not arrive until after you have waited  minutes This is a common scenario where people basically tell you they will be right out but arent ready when they say they will bewhen they know the clock is ticking down Is it so unreasonable to cancel their rides after waiting  minutes

There are other reasons I may cancel on a rider after Ive waited  minutes For instance just last week after I arrived to a passengers pick up location he called me to let him know that I was at the Kum and Go gas station so I drove to the Kum and Go to Meet him Of course no one was there waiting for me the  minute mark had already passed I waited for him for an additional  minutes and because I didnt see anyone I cancelled but not before driving back to the original pickup point because Lyft has a policy of not giving me a  cancellation fee unless I drive back to the original location even if I have waited  minutes even when the passenger told me to meet him at a new pickup locationbut didnt show up Is this unreasonable

Let me tell you another reason I recently cancelled on a passenger I was on my way to pick up a passenger after accepting a ride As I was about  minutes away I received a text message from the passenger asking if his LAWN MOWER would fit in my car Now I dont know about you but if you have ever used a lawn mower they can get very dirty shed grass everywhere and smell like gas Who wants to have someones lawn mover in their car Would you Neither would I so I cancelled

Sometimes I cancel because someone is covered in puke when I arrive You know I drive for Lyft using my own car Im not a health care worker I dont like my car smelling like vomit Would you pick up a passenger covered in vomit or would you cancel In one instance I showed up to pick up a passenger whos friend was vomiting She was nice enough to have a small plastic container for her passenger to puke in after she got in my car but have you ever seen someone puke Its usually a pretty violent action and people certainly aim their puke in a particular direction let alone how much of it will come out Would you pick up that passenger knowing that they might miss the little plastic containing and puke all over your car or would you cancel

I once even had a passenger show up with his passenger who was a young woman who could barely walk truthfully she flopped around like a fish and he was holding a TRASH BAG as they stumbled along and approached my car I actually DID pick them up and miraculously she didnt puke during the ride But you know what I should have done I SHOULD HAVE cancelled as soon as I saw the plastic bag and the woman flopping around like a fish

But you know what Not wanting to get puke in my car isnt the only reason I cancel on passengers I will admit it that even though I try to avoid picking up passengers in neighborhoods where I might get shot I have still risked my safety to pick up many people in these neighborhoods But here is what really stinks

Lets say Im  minutes away from a passenger who lives in a bad neighborhood where I might get shot but just for the heck of it I decide to drive there anyway to pick up the passenger Well in one case I was on my way to pick up a beautiful girl we will just call Angel Even though my car might get shot up and that I might die on my way to pick up Angel who cares because Angel seemed she might be a pretty cool person that I could have a great conversation within the event I lived to pick her up Well after surviving the  minute ride there about three minutes away from meeting Angel the unthinkable happened I hear the Lyft Robot voice who sounds like a psycho killer say

Lyft Pickup Change

You know what It really stinks when you risk your life to drive 
minutes to pick up Angel and get a Lyft pickup change notice just as you are about to arriveand instead of picking up Angel a smelly dude we will just call Earl who hasnt changed his underwear for a week is waiting for you How would you feel in that situation Maybe you love the smell of farts and would drive  minutes to pick up Earl but in my case I didnt accept that ride on the other side of town and risk my life to pick up Earl Would you cancel

Thats actually a true story although the names have been changed to protect those involved and truthfully I cant remember if I cancelled on smelly Earl or not But the point is a driver may accept or deny a ride for variety of reasons whether those reasons are valid or not and yes Im aware that you cant discriminate against anyone for any reason Yet if I accept a ride request for whatever reason and Lyft changes that ride on me without giving me a chance to accept or deny that ride Im fully justified as a driver who is an independent contractor and not an employee of Lyft to cancel that ride

On that note there is another issue here that Lyft needs to address and that is rides that are placed in a drivers queue automatically which the driver does not have the ability to accept or deny

Now if a driver cancels a ride in his or her queue as long as that ride is cancelled before the rider drops off his current passenger that cancellation is not counted against him Please note that Im going to keep using the word he here because Im a dude but not as smelly as the mythical Earl and that yes I realize that there are female drivers too who do a great job driving for Lyft even when they have to pick up smelly dudes like me and Earl

That being said when it gets busy and ride requests come in one after the other especially now while the Covid  virus is floating around and there are WAY less drivers out there than there used to be it can be very difficult to cancel ride request as they come in and keep in mind many of these are usually quite literally  minutes away and on the other side of town and since Lyft DOESNT PAY ME to drive  minutes away to pick them up I decline many of these rides when I can because who wants to drive  minutes and not get paid for it Would you

Well what often happens is that even if you as a driver decline every  minutes away ride request that comes in while your current ride is ending another ride often gets placed in your queue and you as a driver cant do anything to decline it except cancel it when it automatically loads as the next ride In fact the only thing you can do as a driver in these circumstances to block the rides from coming in is to Turn On Last Ride but the problem is because you dont ever have the option of declining these rides and because you as a driver have to cancel them these unwanted rides get counted against you This can easily happen  to  times a DAY Is it fair for Lyft to penalize GOOD drivers like me to be forced to accept then cancel rides that are  minutes away that Lyft wont pay me for and then threaten me to deactivate my driver account when I cancel these rides

Thats why I would really like someone on Lyfts management team to review this message and consider making changes to the Lyft system In a typical busy Friday or Saturday night of driving my Lyft cancellations for rides I cancelled might look something like this

 Smelly Earl Lyft Pickup Change Cancellation
 No Show Cancellations
 Puke Cancellation
 Unsafe Area Cancellation
 Cancellations that I did not have the option to decline that were put in my queue as a ride was ending

If you add up the numbers you get the potential of about  driver cancellations a day that are completely justifiable Sure these arent exact numbers and sure there are many other reasons a driver may cancel most of which are justified and a small minority which may not be justified That being said when I cancel a ride for any reason in my view I have very good reasons to do so Now that Lyft has a better understanding of why some drivers cancel rides especially some of my reasons for cancelling I hope that Lyft would consider making at least some changes especially when the driver cancels rides that are added to his queue as a ride is ending that he does not have the option to decline

One final note I really like driving for Lyft and I hope I have served Lyft well Lyfts customer service representatives are always helpful when I have to write you guys and gals with problems As much as I like Lyft and have attempted to use humor when writing this message I never actually took a wiff of fat Earl although at times I wonder if some of my passengers know what a shower or bath is I want to remind Lyft that Im not an employee and that Im an independent contractor and have the Constitutional right to love liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that means making my own independent decisions about why I may cancel a ride

The Final Word

At least show drivers what their cancellation rate is so that they can keep track of that metric and try to lower it using actual data rather than trying to guess what that number is or how far over that undefined threshold will cause them to get deactivated as drivers Im sure Lyft has a building full of Lawyers but ride share companies do get taken to court which could result in millions of dollars in damages if a judge rules against Lyft in a class action lawsuit for wrongful termination of independent contractors Just think how much money Lyft could save by taking my advice in this message You are welcome Lyft As always keep up the good work and please remove the flag on my account due to too many cancellations as flagging my account for this reason is totally unfair

"I get a ping  I accepted shortly after I received a phone call that I was delivering an envelope Account holder called back asked me to wait a few minutes 

I figured sure I set lyft to the city of the destination and waited A few a few minutes later an elderly woman came outside she seemed angry and anxious and wanted to know why I was in front of her house I explained who I was I asked if she was okay she said no 

She was on the phone with someone obviously uncomfortable with the situation This made me uncomfortable with the situation I asked her what was going on she wouldnt tell me 

At this point my spider senses are screaming at me I stuck around out of concern for the little old lady and also for selfish reasons The potential of double dipping on a lyft fare and an uber fare plus I need to head down to near that city  miles away for something 

She went in the house and came back out I was half expecting the cops to show up any minute She told me to wait a minute she had to get it ready to transport She comes out with some papers and a manilla envelope I asked if I could look inside before I took it She was very hesitant but then handed me the papers and the envelope and told me to go ahead and count it 

Brake screech 

Count it Wtf I felt the envelope felt like two bundles of cash I asked her if she just handed me cash and again asked if she was all right She just said no but wouldnt talk to me 

I started the trip and Googled the address it was a shopping center in S FL I handed her the papers and envelope back and told her this doesnt feel right at all Her neighbor came outside and she called him over younger guy  She still wouldnt talk to me but was talking to him within earshot of me I could hear most of the conversation 

She had received a call from her grandson Hed been arrested blah blah As soon as I heard that it all clicked The neighbor knew too and told me to go I wanted to make sure the woman knew they were trying to scam her so I stuck around a few minutes 

I never looked at the papers or opened the envelope I let uber know it was a scam account they havent replied yet I am hesitant about cling the police or the critical uber line knowing uber my account gets deactivated I told her to call the police and the neighbor said hed look after her 

Its an old scam apparently still effective I heard her tell the neighbor there was  in cash and a cashiers check for  in the envelope

"Today I have my first airport trip in  that comes with a nice surge and very generous tip




Here is the story explaining why I gave him  stars Soon after I received a request from Ryan who lives in a luxurious apartment complex he called me to ask if I could drive to his building He said it was not a big deal if I didnt wanted to but he needed some time to walk to the front gate I agreed and then he told me the gate code and directions to his building Everything sounds fine until I arrived

This is the first time ever that a passenger signals for a hand shake Awkward enough instead of a brief one he rubbed my hand with his left hand and said how come you are so soft and smooth I withdrew my hand immediately and told him that the trunk was ready for his  large pieces of luggage Apparently he did not get the sign that I was not in the mood for a conversation after giving him minimal replies to the usual questions like what do you do and how do you like driving Uber

He then asked me the brand of handcream shampoo body wash and perfume that I use I told him that those questions were too personal He apologized and said the questions were asked out of curiosity thinking it would be nice if his wife could use the same products The minute drive in general was uneventful As usual I popped the trunk and stepped aside for him to unload at the terminal He put forward his hand again but sorry not another time I then declined politely with a smile and said  have a good day and enjoy your flight sir

I pull into the lot and there are a male and female standing there waiting Names are confirmed and she gets in I swipe start UberX and it requests a PIN I ask Shannon for her PIN and she has no idea what I am talking about I explain this randomly happens she just needs to look in her app She cant find it

No problem I hit Rider cant find PIN and it asks for the last  digits of her phone number That doesnt work either At this point I learn that Shannon has took many Uber trips and has never had to do this before like Im getting a kick out of this Her friend starts telling me that she is having a bad day and just to drive them

I show them my screen I enter the number in front of them ride wont start She shows me the phone number in the app The last  match what we were entering and I see myself as her driver so I know this isnt a scam its an Uber fk up 

I tell them I cant do anything at this point and thats when Shannon demands her money back I explain Ive been paid nothing and will get nothing until the ride starts so she needs to contact Uber Support The passenger tells me that Im being a dick and getting one stard for this trip Well at this point Im not doing the trip even if the PIN showed up on her phone They were told to exit the vehicle which they did leaving both back doors wide open

I accelerate heavily and the doors close I Uturn back towards the entranceexit and the PIN required disappears I stop somewhat near the passengers and she starts yelling at me that she isnt going to pay a cancellation fee No problem I let her know Ill cancel on my side and she can make a new request Countdown has hit  min and I collect my  Go fk yourself Shannon

"So I get a ghetto XL ping Ghetto XL rides are the worst Usually they are requesting an XL ride because they have a whole herd of little kids with no car seats or they have more people that can even fit in an XL ride or they have a huge pile of stinky laundry in giant cloth bags to go to the laundromat

So far its not helped Even though people have kids with no car seats or more passengers than I can carry they dont cancel the ride I did have one lady text back and say no car seats Sure enough when I got to the pick up there she was with tiny tots and no car seats

I politely explain that we are just here to drive people and that I cant jump start his car I dont even have jumper cables He tells me he has some I again tell him that we are not here to do that and that I would gladly drive him to work if he wants He continues trying to get me to jump start his car I finally tell him No especially not in the pouring rain Were just not here to do that Youshould probably call AAA or someone like that to help you do that

"Lately I have been getting a huge number of pings from JenCare Senior Medical Centers 

Had one today that I had picked up previously a very nice old man  that can barely walk let alone get into and out of my Civic without assistance 

It took him about six minutes to get into the car today this time picking him up at his residence and taking him to the clinic 

While I spent many years doing medical transport Advanced Life Support and limited mobility BS runs and  me trying to assist someone with the possibility of them falling and breaking their hip for  literally this fare is not happening 

Got to JenCare told him to sit tight while I asked for help A few minutes later I was greeted by his actual physician the receptionist and a nurse  with a wheelchair It took the three of them about another five minutes to get him out of the car 

The doctor could not have been more understanding that this is unacceptable promised that he would be transported in their wheelchair van from now on parked right there 

I explained that we get these pings like any other  we are NOT dedicated to medical transport receive any sort of training and that many drivers themselves may have physical limitations She did not seem to understand that nor do these pax and thanked me for the information 

This gentleman was actually going to the clinic because he had fallen and broken several bones  so an Uber for a high fall risk patient Triple bypass negative

Its one thing if a passenger is handicap Its another if insurance is paying for the trip and the more appropriate solution is a wheelchair van 

Two pings later pick up at an ER Pax was standing with a staff member no mask Told the staff member that masks are required so she went to get one  then dropped it and went for another 

Meanwhile the pax kept tugging on the locked door handle I said three times that she needs a mask to enter Then she says Ill ride in the trunk and meant it 

Pretty clear that this was a psych patient and I noped out with No mask or face covering

A strange question I thought What other reason could there possibly be for me to be out here driving drunks around Anyway the images of what the work might entail were already taking turns presenting themselves inside of my head like a slide show Drugs run Click Dress up in gimp suit Click Getaway driver

Me  Doing what
Pax  I need you to drive me and my  bros to LA in my car Im trying to get my car back home You could have one of your friends follow us in your car so you can get back here How much do you want to do that  bucks

Lets pause the anecdote to examine the pros and cons

Pros

 bucks is on the table Its a strong first offer Dude sounds desperate Thered likely be more money if pushed

Cons

Its a crew of  drunk dudes at  on a Saturday night so you know itd be an easy ride thumbup What could possibly go wrong

"So yesterday I was driving down the  freeway in the Del Mar area and I wanted to change lanes to speed up I was about to get over when this Range Rover sped up and thwarted my attempt  I got over once he passed and noticed right away that he had no license plate on the back

The missing plate on this Range Rover made me reflect on my own recent stolen license plate nightmare I also have a local friend whos plate was stolen this month

I was behind the Range Rover for a good  seconds when he quickly passed two cars and I lost site for a few moments  I then changed lanes and caught up to his car

At that point I observed that he somehow HAD A LICENSE PLATE on his car WTF Am I losing my mind I pulled up along side to see whos driving and low and behold  It was Bruce Fricken Willis You read that right

He noticed I saw him and from that point on he wouldnt let me get along side to take a photo of him I could only keep up from a few cars back

When I got home I looked up License Plate Hiders and they are a real thing  It would make sense that a celebrity of his level would have a James Bondie device like that

"It is a funny story but I picked up these young white couple man and woman in Uptown Minneapolis I normally dont have any issues with white folks in Uptown Minneapolis btw Their destination was in downtown area which Lyndale directly connects to but Lyndale has traffic jams sometimes so I avoid it That was the time th was open before the current construction project on iW Mouth into Minneapolis So as I drove south bound towards th St that had iW North freeway entrance towards downtown The woman nervously starting saying Youre going opposite way of where were going dude I sensed some fear in her when she said that I then calmly told her I am trying to get on th so I can head towards downtown And then they reminded me of that scary movie where that Cab driver locked the people in to kidnap them and when they tried to use the pull up lock it turned out to be a sharp one that cut their fingers But that incident with those Pax made me wonder if most Pax fear kidnapping or something else from the driver I think a good chunk of Pax have a fear of the driver himself If it is a woman driver I am sure their fear would be reduced substantially

I heard Pennsylvania is really messed up in road quality I hope they start modernizing that bad boy I noticed they started laying new Asphalt technology in some streets of Minnesota Hopefully that beats the winter and lasts a long time Potholes are freaking terrible so driving on bad road quality with bad old Asphalt takes a toll on our tires and wears them out faster and am sure as an Uber driver you hate that because it means getting new tires or struts or brake pads Oh speaking of pot hole damage did you know you can submit a claim to the City or State to get reimbursed for damage you paid to get repaired on your car from a bad pot hole you hit or some bad bump from folded up old asphalt on the freeway Your struts get damaged you can file usually the State has a web page dedicated to submitting for reimbursement of repair you did due to a Pot hole City of Minneapolis also has that and am sure a lot if not all of US Cities have that

"Another Chicago night another interesting love story I feel compelled to share I picked up a young man from his friends place near Wrigley Field by Addison and Clark and drove him to the north side of the city in Lincoln Park During the ride he shared with me that he was recently graduated from law school His story went on that he had a loving relationship with his psychiatrist while in law school and she was  years old She was treating him at the time I did not ask his diagnosis nor did he share it They fell in love and his parents sued her and reported her to the Indiana Medical Board He told me that she lost her license to practice medicine as a result Understandably his parents were very upset because of the incredible age difference 

So she is planning to move to Chicago and start a new life with him He said he was  years old and said she looks decades younger and the love was real and deep and she has a great figure He said he feels so much guilt at her losing her license and will do everything he can to rebuild her life in Chicago He told me that he works for the city as a Public Defender even told me his salary which I did not ask He said he makes year Finally he informed me that he is determined to make it work Please send well wishes his way and hers that the relationship will be successful I know I was very touched by his love for her and her devotion and sacrifice for him",0.9918,0.033,0.787,0.18,Positive,0.18,0.08,0.16,0.29,0.29,2020,Young Kim

"I got my message saying its vehicle inspection time So Im a bit nervous because I dont know if my new mechanic who is ASE certified will do it and I dread going to Jiffy Jube or some of the other approved Uber  Lyft vehilce inspection stations

My reasoning is when I first signed up for Uber  Lyft my power windows in the back didnt work I had them fixed went back to my mechanic and the guy from ABC Garage looked around with his clipboard and approved it but he didnt seem happy about it Then I hear some people here dont have working AC working windows and still drive Ive seen cars missing headlights with all kinds of accident damage and that have been sideswiped driving around with Lyft Uber stickers and passengers inside

When I went to Firestone once for my inspection I was told I had a nail in my rear tire and thats a fail but if I buy a new tire from them it will pass So I worked as a mechanic specifically I cut my teeth mounting tires patching them plugging them My tire was pluggable it was not on the outside of the tread close enough to the sidewall Firestone just wanted  from me on top of the inspection fee Needless to say I went to Costco and they plugged it drove back to Firestone the next day and they were PISSED However I said  Does it pass or not The tire is fixed no more nail She begrudgingly signed the form

Im a car guy I know most of the scams Ive told dealers to put the tires back on my brakes are fine theyll last at least  more miles and Ill replace the pads myself and turn the rotors You dont need to collect  in labor for  minutes of work Ill come back when I cant fix it Jiffy Lube is an approved Uber vehicle inspection station This is laughable

Jiffy Lube damages more cars then fixes them I cant tell you the horror stories Ive heard like a common oneThey didnt tighten my drain plug and my motor seized and they wont replace my motor Yes this happens alot there or they pressure flush your automatic transmission and damage the seals and charge you to do it So look Im not an idiot When I ask a mechanic a question and they respond with the wrong answer you dont touch my car you dont get my business

I ran over one of those stupid scooters The rider jumped off as it coasted right in front of me Tore up my front bumper and scuffed the side and rear of my van The rider of course disappeared before i could get stopped The following day I contacted the scooter company and told them what happened I got a canned response and when I sent a more detailed email including pictures of the scooter and my van I got a response to their legal team that they are not liable for things that their Riders do and I need to contact my insurance company to see about getting my car fixed When I asked for their Riders information so I could pursue legal actions against the writer I was told that they cannot give that out for privacy reasons and I need to contact my automobile insurance company to get my vehicle fixed

I never go above the speed limit but there was a guy who must have been in a hurry because he was tailgating me so close that I could see his face like he was sitting in my rear seats Maybe a few inches away Since I had a passenger I dismissed of course actually hitting the brakes But I thought to myself if I was alone I really would have wanted to do it He would certainly have hit my car because his was a larger SUV and since mine is a very lightweight Prius I could stop on a dime

"Just dropped off lady pax to the south side of Chicago earlier this afternoon Had a passionate talk about the citys rioting and looting What struck me was her strong emotions on this I picked her up from the Enterprise Rent a Car in Park Ridge IL When she got in I saw that the ride was  minutes long going to th and King Dr in the citys south side the ride took  minutes due to traffic

I started the conversation off by asking her why she rented a car all the way out here in the suburbs instead of a place closer to the city She told me that renting a car in the city is more expensive because of city taxes the cars are kept up nicer in the suburbs and there are few cars for rent in the city where she lives

Then I asked her how she feels living in the city where so many buildings have wooden planks covering the windows after the destruction and looting She replied with strong words that it was to be expected by white America and that Blacks are not necessarily feeling that they are lootingdestroying their own community as the media likes to project because she said none of it was theirs anyway

So she just stopped of saying it should all be burned and looted but she felt that it is  She is tired of people saying Blacks are irrational because they are destroying what is theirs She said they are just reacting to having no opportunities and the ransacking of downtown was meant as a statement because the Magnificent Mile is a symbol of the wealth inequality

She repeated said that white America is being hypocritical by blaming Black Americans because she stated that America was founded on violence anyway She said that from the beginning the whites burned and pillaged just like what is happening in present cities at the start of the country

She brought up about the issue regarding the theft of property going on that whites did the same and worse to the Native Americans Regarding rioting and burning she pointed out multiple instances where whites rioted and burned just like the Blacks are doing now when there was forced school integration in the s So she said violence is at the heart of Americas DNA

She concluded that white America should just keep quiet and try to figure out a solution to the ridiculous wealth disparity going on now I usually never pick sides but rather I am a careful listener and try to understand where people are coming from I did however agree with her that in past history World History that whenever the wealth disparity got go lopsided social revolutions followed

She complained also that politicians are really dragging their feet about the new stimulus and that made her very angry Especially because most of the politicians are so wealthy She said that people love to spend money so why not stimulate She said it would help everyone now because people are suffering presently

As I dropped her off we did notice many buildings that were boarded up and I quietly hoped that all this would stop in Chicago She extremely friendly and I wished her well and that her car would be fixed soon",0.013,0.11,0.778,0.112,Negative,0.13,0.03,0.2,0.2,0.44,2020,Young Kim

I set off for his destination and drove about half a mile with him out of the valley and still the signal had not returned I told him that I know from experience that with Uber no signal means no pay for me He told me that many other drivers start the trip from his house and get paid But there was no way he could know if the drivers got paid or not

He was already on thin ice for not being out and ready and messing me around at the pick up so I kicked him out and told him to tell Uber to pay drivers when there is no cell signal if he wanted to complain I would only have lost a few bucks for the part of the ride when there was no signal but when Uber stung me last time over a similar situation and refused to pay I did tell Rohit that if it happened again then I would eject the pax immediately

Plus I was in no mood for any bullshit from this pax

Anyway what do you do when theres no cell signal on your ride",-0.9711,0.11,0.879,0.011,Negative,0.03,0.06,0.15,0.44,0.32,2020,The Gift of Fish

When I got home I ended up putting  miles in for the day  miles more than driving straight home Those  rides paid me  including  in tolls or  per extra mile driven Plus almost half my normal tolls home were paid

"I was on a residential street just got my noshow approved and business was slow Its one pm so Im not hurting not bothered by business being slow

Good neighborhood so I just parked on the street for a while

I see a car park and someone dashed out or the car and to the front door or this house pick up an Amazon box and run back They stop  houses down and repeat I put the car and gear and start following them they stop in front of a house realize Im behind them and dash off I take note of their plate number and call  They pull over half a dozen houses down and I see someone run up to a door and come back with a brown paper bag and a drink holder



I shit you not the porch pirate on top or Amazon orders stopped and picked up someones food delivery while they were at it right from in front of their door



A few minutes later the cops come out and I give my statement Tell him the plate  and he takes his report


He goes up to the house and leaves notices that their stuff got jacked but the food delivery victim comes to the door Next thing I know the cop points to me and the lady walks over

I roll my window down and she thanks me for taking the time to report it She goes on to tell me that shes had Amazon deliveries go missing recently as well


The cop comes back to ask for the camera footage and I tell him to contact the cab company and they would connect him to people with the power to pull the camera and get him the correct contact people


He thanks for the taking the time I head to the company radio shop as Im not far away

I tell them at the radio shop that the cops are going to ask for it if they havent already


Im already down the road done before I get told to bring the car in lol




So the cops have enough to nail this porch pirate for  counts of theft witness statement on one video evidence on  and 

The cop told me that with the dash camera video they should be able to get warrants to search their residences for more stolen stuff and it would Probably snowball with more charges

"Saturday night Sunday morning just before  am things are slowing down and lots of ants still out I am parked outside one of the few spots left open to get a ride about  miles from home so I set DF to home and hope I get a ride at least part of the way toward home About  minutes go by and I get a ping  minutes in the wrong direction however it is  minutes toward my destination Great I accept it

Get there and there are two people outside a bar  smoking and the other just milling around About  minutes of waiting and the person smoking goes back in the bar The other person continues milling around About  seconds before the shuffle time pops up the person milling around walks up to my window and identifies himself as my PAX I confirm his name and ask destination before unlocking the door to make sure it is the way I want to go His destination is strange a restaurant that closed over  hours ago kind of a remote place for this area

PAX gets in and we head toward destination PAX is quite at first then starts asking strange questions and making strange comments Nothing offensive just strange I can hear him digging through his small backpack several times I start getting that uneasy feeling

He says in a mumbling voice that he is glad he will be starting a second job soon I ask him where and he says I cant remember its South I ask is it a hotel or restaurant and he says I guess I should have asked At this point my creep alarm is on super high alert I nonchalantly confirm my self protection tools are properly staged and I move my pepper spray to a quick grab position Manually unlock my door and make sure my seat belt release is not obstructed I just had a bad feeling at this point

My standard procedure is start trip and take a snap shot of the waybill Second guessing I did that this time and my creep alarm going overboard I take another screen shot of the waybill just to make sure I have it About a minute after doing this the PAX asks did you take a picture I simply say I took a screen shot of my trip information for my records At this point we are two minutes from destination He replies I thought you took my picture I said no need to do that the dash cam records everything and saves it to the cloud okay the cloud part was a lie but he had no way of knowing that I also point at that dash cam that is obviously right there He implied he never saw it 

We pull up to the restaurant and I ask him do you want dropped in front or on the side He replies oh go past the restaurant and turn right on the first road I live in the first building on the right I do that and stop at the first building He says no go to the end of the road and turn left and I am in the first building on the right Okay there is no building on the right after you turn left now my creep alarm is really going into overtime I stop in the very back of the complex about  yards from the road and just stare at him through the mirror He finally gets out and I immediately lock the doors and start driving off I turn the corner and head out to the side road I get to the stop sign at the main road and make a quick entry in my log book maybe  seconds at the most I look in my mirror and the PAX is walking toward my car What theI hit the gas and turn on to the main road and get the heck out of there

Now for this guy to get to the road that fast after I dropped him off he had to be running back to the road through the complex I thought for sure this guy was going to try and rob me or something I have never had such a bad feeling from a PAX in the  years I have been doing this

I was constantly evaluating my options once my creep alarm started going off and hoping I would pass a deputy sheriff on the side of the road like I usually do in this area and time of night no luck Because of the lack of cars on the road I figured my best option was to just be ready and finish the trip While watching the dash cam footage this morning of the ride I got that same uneasy feeling I think this guy was up to no good and started second guessing himself

"Theres a few places in my market NJ where ghetto cars abound In fact you see car carriers hauling cars that look like they would be headed to the crusher but theyre not theyre headed to the local Auto Mall where people buy these smashed up poorly maintained vehicles

In fact you see these total jalopy vehicles with paper temporary tags Somebody just got their new car

At a glance you can easily spot a handful of inspection violations Things like no headlights or taillights cracked windshield missing mirrors and belching smoke like a coal fired locomotive just to name a few

One thing all these cars have in common is the paints clear coat and some of the color coat below is weather etched away to some degree from all the horizontal surfaces It makes me wonder if they dont bring these cars up from the south

I kept thinking How do these cars make it through inspection Even if you could get the inspector to look the other way about the missingbroken lights and mirrors bald tires bad brakes etc theres no way the vehicle would pass the part of the test where they connect the states inspection computer to the cars OBD port and read the VIN and any check engine light error codes

Then it hit me game show winning answer bell ding ding ding ding They buy cars so old that they have no OBD port That way the inspection is merely a physicalvisual inspection by the inspector and they put a smog sniffer in the tail pipe The inspector certifies that he put the smog sniffer into the vehicle needing inspection but of course thats not what he does He uses a different vehicle that can pass the smog test Then gets a wad of cash from the ghetto car owner and slaps a valid inspection sticker on the windshield

"The reason I finally quit after a year in working for all of these clowns food delivery apps was because of the fact that it was nothing more then a buildup to that fact finally occurring

I finally had enough with being blamed for things that where out of my control whether having to deal with traffic construction issues on the road bad drivers bad weather and everything else in between

I finally had enough of playing this wheres waldo game with the customers who for some reason could never give me their right addresses let alone their correct telephone numbers or delivery instructions on where to drop the food and always expecting me to do door to door deliveries Im sorry but this is not get the door its dominos they should come outside and meet you Im a courier remember Im not your babysitter that was expected to hold your hand

Also forget about dealing with customer service between all these delivery apps because they were useless and beyond destruction and people wonder why their food was always late never mind the fact that once I got to the restaurant the food was never ready and that was with all of them not just Uber or Doordash

A total lack of organization from top to bottom and who gets blamed for all this horse hockey the driver what finally happened in making me quit was because I was on a double delivery for Doordash The first order ended up being late to be dropped off because of the fact that I had to wait for the second order to be prepared and to make the drop off for that customer

So to make a long story short I got into a shouting match with the customer whos order was late trying to explain to them what was going on and they didnt want to hear it so I lost it with them and cussed them out and slammed the telephone on their face and it was a long time coming

After  deliveries between all with these cats combined and this is how it ended and thank god I say and good riddance I should have quit a long time ago and as far as Im concerned so should everyone else I wasnt even making minimum wage for god sakes if you factor in the gas that had to be pumped on a constant bases and maintenance of the car

I had all my accounts deactivated and cut up all the debit cards and it felt great once it was finally done There is a brighter future for me over the horizon and I will be moving on to the next adventure in my life and will be better off in doing so

These app companies are nothing more then a detriment to society it has created a new legion of lazy bums who dont want to go out and even pickup their food anymore let alone eat at the restaurants either

The drivers are now nothing more then truck drivers on a miniature scale spending all their time on the road living lives of solitude stress and pressure to make a few peanuts and are getting screwed by the customers in terms of not being tipped and having to deal with their attitudes of entitlement and bad behavior and also by the restaurants not caring when they hand the food off to the driver

But least of all the restaurants are being screwed by these app companies with their god forsaken fees that they are being charged to use their services so everyone is being destroyed except for those at the top of these fly by night companies

like I said before the sooner these app companies die and the sooner this entire gig economy dies the better we will all be for it Ive even heard as of recent that Uber and Doordash were trying to merge thats just what we need one great big incompetent corporation

Oh and by the way I worked out of the Portland Oregon Metro market one of the worst places in terms of traffic and road conditions in the country especially due to the weather and all the construction constantly going on and having bad infrastructure over all

When I swiped to end the trip I had to first swipe to confirm stop because she had accidentally or so I thought entered it into her app as a multistop trip When I swiped I saw the next stop come up


Canada Not somewhere else in the NYNJ metropolitan area not somewhere else in America not even anywhere specific in Canada Just Canada I chuckled took a screenshot and swiped confirm stop again Then I saw ANOTHER stop in the trip which was the original address of the starting point of the trip an hour away I thought this was weird but its the kind of thing someone could do if theyre really bad at using the app I swiped to complete the ride and headed back home to New Jersey

My pay for the trip was  which included  in tolls because we went from NJ to NY and then crossed the Verrazano For those of you not from the NYNJ area that is not an unusual toll amount for a trip like this A few hours later I looked and saw that my gross earnings amount had been adjusted down to  which means all of my pay and tolls had been taken away and I still had to pay for the the extra permile insurance I opted into I am still working with the fine folks in India to get my money back and I might have to make a hour round trip to a Greenlight Hub to get this cleared up

Thinking through it after the fact its obvious what happened The pax who acted nice and talked with me about kids and careers and life goals set me up so that she could call in and claim I never gave her the ride By her design the ride didnt start at her requested start location it didnt end at her requested end location and it didnt go to the locations of the additional stops Free ride to the city for her hours of difficulty and frustration for me

Here is the moral of the story that I will take away and suggest to all of you Start your trips at the start pin end your trips at the end pin and confirm extra stops with the pax before you start rolling If start location end location or extra stops need to change instruct your pax to change them in the app If they will not either cancel the ride or take them where the app says to take them even if they might rate you poorly

And to Cristina if youre out there reading this I hope youre doing well that work has been going better for you this week and that your baby boy is sleeping better I understand it must be hard to make ends meet while you take care of this baby and commute back and forth to the city I forgive you for what youve done to me But I hope you will make it right and not do this to anyone else",0.9061,0.068,0.865,0.068,Positive,0.08,0.09,0.33,0.14,0.35,2019,MondayMan

"So I was  points from Platinum Status this morning so I turned the UBER App on after noon looking to get  short rides at  points a piece  to lock in Platinum until the end of January 

Got a couple short rides while I did my Sunday errands

Eventually I got a ride to Pearson Airport TORONTO and then another ride not a rematch downtown

Lakeshore Boulevard was closed and thus it was a special kind of  on Fleet Street

While i was waiting for many light cycles to eventually turn left onto Ft York I heard on the radio that the COVID cases in Ontario had crossed day for the first time I thought perfect I get one more ride on DF and I hang up the keys until things settle for a while

On the th ride from BathurstFortYork to Church  Charles PAX dropped their pin on the wrong condo and I was about to shuffle after texting the woman and her boyfriend why I was on Bastion instead of at her Condo they eventually walked to me She gives me some flack about the address I show where she dropped the pin and that I am exactly where the pin is I tell them I have no info beyond that

Thus the ride begins on the wrong foot

However I recovered when the dude really like the interior leather styling of the my car so we talk about that for a bit I tell them Im impressed that after  rides and  years of driving mainly the night shift that the leather has held up so well She asks me if anyone has every puked in the car I tell her that Im picky about the kind of drunk I may or may not pick up at am She asks me what is the worst thing has happened I tell her the story about the dude that got in covered in blood on Mercer St after being in a full street fight And how I didnt know at the time as it was dark lesson learned about the super late drunk shift No bad pukers though

We are driving up Spadina and turn onto Wellesley 

To make matters worse as I approach Church street there is an Ambulance with full sirens and lights coming up behind me about  cars back as I am at the intersection

There are cars parked on both sides of Wellesley so nowhere to pull over and it is wall to wall cars behind me

As the light turns yellow I make my left turn onto Church Street in the north direction Right into an oncoming Fire Engine coming south on Church The fire truck was in the wrong lane to negotiate the intersection

I did not hear the fire truck because of the Ambulance

We miss collision by about  cm Thats about  inches

Passengers in the back are freaking out with a window full of fire truck I manage to pull onto the east side of Church to take a breather

I told the ladypax Congrats In all of my  years of GigDriving that was the most dangerous thing that ever happened You get to be part of the story She was not impressed

Either way 

And it was also the universe giving me an unambiguous sign to take a good long break from RidehailGig Driving as per my day resolution to stop driving

I hopped on the highway after that and drove home

" because all I have is hindsight

As we all know because of the COVID virus we are not supposed to touch a passengers belongings

Well I accept an Uber ride and arrive at the pick up and its a woman in a wheelchair and theres nobody there to help her This means Id have to handle her wheelchair

Before any of you light your hair on fire Ive carried an untold number of people with wheelchairs walkers etc I have no problem with that and I do it all the time

However now that were under this whole thing with COVID if I handle the persons belongings Im putting myself and the company at risk to be sued Congress still has not yet passed any limits on COVID liability

So I asked the woman if theres anyone who can help her with the wheelchair She says no I informed her that were not supposed to handle a persons belongings I was about to cancel the ride but I really didnt want to leave the woman stranded Not because I was worried that I would get reported for refusing to carry somebody with a wheelchair since I would only be following the companies rules about not touching a persons belongings I didnt want to leave her out of sympathy Im realizing now that Im probably going to get one starred for doing my good deed

So I asked her if shes OK with me touching her wheelchair and she said that was fine She gets in the car I put the wheelchair in and off we go

Then three times during the ride she mentions that shes going to call up Uber and ask him about this thing about a driver not being able to touch her riders belongings

It was at this point that I realized that she was a lot more pissed off than she was appearing and she was also failing to see that I had done a good deed by bending the rules in order to accommodate her She clearly was not appreciative

When the ride was over I called Uber to ask what I should do in a situation like that where theres a rider who needs physical assistance yet at the same time were under a company wide rule of not touching a passengers belongings

All I ever got back from the company was an email with the standard boilerplate stating how we are always supposed to make every attempt to assist a writer with a disability I guess theyre more afraid of those kinds of lawsuits then a COVID lawsuit

Oh and by the way I did get the one star and a service complaint from that limp legger as well

So this only makes me more dedicated to following my own role that you either A Cancel a ride before starting it or B Drive the ride with a smile without any complaining Complaining and then driving the ride or driving the ride while complaining only guarantees you problems",0.7098,0.088,0.811,0.101,Positive,0.15,0.03,0.2,0.28,0.34,2020,LyftUberFuwabolewa

Need two more rides to finish up for the night and Im in the downtown area Get a ping for a pick up at a club

Great nice girlfriends I thought to ditch their friend in this condition

So on we go luckily she only lives about  minutes away because I was worried shed throw up in her sleep

We get to destination she lives in a row house on a narrow street and I cant get her to wake up to get her out of the car so I park on the sidewalkyard so I dont block traffic 

I open the back door yelling to try to get her awake literally have to sit her up in the seat she comes to enough I tell her to put her feet out the door she says yes sir and puts one foot out and slumps over passed out again I get her to come to again this time both feet out the door and she manages to stand up every time I ask her to stand up its yes sir she mustve thought I was a cop

I hand her her purse and phone and shes looking in my car asking wheres baby

Whos baby I ask

Luna my dog she was in there

Great now Im wondering if its just booze shes had tonight Hallucinating her dog was in the car and Im trying to reason with someone out of their mind that her dog isnt in the car

I finally convince her the dog is in her house she mumbles something about Luna breaking her leg as I help her up the steps 

I wait on the top step making sure she makes it inside and swipe this damn ride as OVER

"Okay this happened to me as a passenger It happened last Saturday night in St Pete I was at the local watering hole and some guy came up to me and starting striking up a conversation I am normally cool and talk to everyone but this guy seemed downright strange He kept working his way closer and closer to me and then I walked away I am a strong believer in personal space I sat at the bar and proceeded to order another drink This same guy came over and just sat down next to me I said Sir I am saving that seat for someone He looked around and laughed At this point I moved to another part of the bar This guy started to move over and I told the bartender to tab me out and she noticed the situation and did not hesitate I quickly got on my phone and ordered the Uber 

The pricing was at surge and the driver was  minutes away I said Sht under my breath I signed the receipt and started to head for the door and the guy was chasing me at this point I walked outside and waited for my Uber driver The guy came out of the bar and I just stated that I was waiting for my ride 

The truck the Uber driver is in pulls up and the guy pulls me by the arm and I pull away and just say Leave me the hell alone The Uber driver then places his truck into park steps out calmly and pulls a switch blade He says nothing and the guy lets me get into the truck I am scared and the driver insists I sit up front He tells me that he had to do that several times before but he has never had to do that for another guy I thank him for the ride tipped him  and got home SAFELY

"I should have known better That is the primary lesson here
It was slow last night and I FOOLISHLY accepted a  STAR passenger lets call her N who happened to be nearby at pm and was via Uber Pros time and direction info doing a halfway decent length trip on UBER
I arrive in the condotownhouse complex
Three people smoking on the stoop
N walks towards me with a pizza box Pizzaiolo Small in her hand
I roll down the window as she approaches and ask Do you have a face covering
She holds up a mask in her hand
I say Can you please put it on
She says Yes while trying the handle
I roll down the passenger rear window Im going to need that on before you get in the car
She angrily THROWS the pizza box in my car nearly hitting me in the head

Enough of this I havent started the ride yet Count down timer is still going Time to SHUFFLE for NoMask

She starts screaming behind me

I leave the complex and notice that she has also flung her phone into my seat

I am driving along Thomas St in Mississauga and am about to pull over when a JEEP pulls up behind me at high speed then make a sharp swerve in front of me at the Thomas GlenErin Light There is no traffic at that hour 
Her two smoking buddies dudes get out of the jeep and cross their arms She comes running out You STOLE my phone  
I reach in the back seat grab her phone and hand it to her silently Im not going to escalate this any further She gives me the finger and screams again as she gets back into the Jeep Her pals do a donut around my car in the middle of the intersection Another driver who has stopped at the red light on the other side of the intersection looks on with curiosity

I drive off to another block park on a side street and end the ride selecting NO MASK
I discard the pizza box left on my seat from the throwing incident It is garbage day tomorrow in this neighborhood so I just leave it with one of the houses curbside pile of trash which had a few Pizza Nova boxes off to the side

I file a report with Ubers App Trip Issues but have to attach it to another previous in the day cancelled ride as the last ride doesnt show up in my history because the ride was not started beyond the count down clock screen

I get another ride request while Im doing that Just before I drop off the passenger I get a phone call from the UBER Safety Team But I let it go to voice mail as Im still completing this current ride

I call them back and talk to the person explaining the above to UBER Safety  passenger N with the  STAR rating was out of line with throwing objects into my vehicle and then chasing me down at speed on a residential roadway They say they will look into it

My account goes OFFLINE minutes later with the BLUE STRIPE in the driver app YOUR ACCOUNT HAS AN ISSUE

"Names have been changed in this story so I dont disappear

Ill start with some background information When I first moved to New Jersey it wasnt long before a guy who called himself Paul from Brooklyn stopped me in the parking lot of my workplace to welcome me to the area and to tell me who I should meet He told me several names of people who owned businesses in the area He said When the lights go out these are the guys with the generators Later I googled some of the names and found several old New York Times articles about their suspected involvement in mob hits bribing judges etc Then finally he told me the name of an Italian restaurant where the higherups meet for dinner every Thursday night Which takes us to last night a Thursday

I dont usually drive in the evening but Uber suckered me into it with a quest If I gave four more rides for the week Id get a  bonus and that seemed meh ok so out I went after my kids bedtime

After three rides my fourth and final ping of the night came from Frankie at the Italian restaurant that Paul from Brooklyn told me about I pulled up and saw two men and a woman at the corner I stopped right behind a Rolls Royce unlocked my doors and confirmed the name One of the men tried to get in the front seat but I asked him to ride in the back because of the covid regulations They werent excited about cramming threewide into the back seat of my compact car but they said they were only going three blocks so theyd do it

Me joking Is that your Rolls Royce

Frankie Yeah I just had a few too many so Im gonna leave it here for the night

Other guy Wanna race

Me Ha ha Do you guys live around here

Frankie Dont ask questions just drive

Me Ha ha ok

Me How is that restaurant Sorry I know thats another question

Frankie silence

Me dropping them off Ok nice meeting you guys Sorry again for the close quarters in the back seat Have a good night

"In California Uber currently tells drivers at ping time the estimated value of each fare Early this morning I received a x surge ping that Uber valued at    with a pickup in Redwood City CA and destination Los Angeles  miles away




I accepted the ping assuming that that pax was a numpty who had entered an incorrect destination I planned to arrive at the pickup and have the pax enter the correct destination preserving the x surge for the ride I set off for the pickup which was  minutes away

Around  minutes after I accepted the ping I got a message from the account holder She said that I would be picking up John and taking him to LA I texted back asking her if she was aware that the fare would be around  and that it was a x surge She replied that when she booked the ride yesterday her Uber app had given her an estimate of between    I told her again that if her friend took the ride the fare would be around  She replied that the friend must get to LA that I should pick him up and do the ride and that if Uber charged her that amount then she would fight it with Uber

So sports fans there was a decision to make The three options were

a Shuffle the pax Because of the distance I drove to the pickup the no show fee would have been around  bucks

Advantage It would be  bucks

Disadvantage It would be  bucks

b Do the ride For any noob drivers playing along at home this ride request raised red flags The first was that the account holder would not be travelling therefore there would be no gps record of any pax travelling with me Second it would have been an extremely high value fare and subject to Ubers review process I would not be paid the fare unless and until Uber approved payment to me Third the account holder had already confirmed that if she got billed  which she indeed would be she would fight the fare with Uber

Advantage If paid out by Uber this would be an enormous fare I had just bought  nocommission pings for  from Uber so I would keep the entire amount paid by the pax less  for the ride fee

Disadvantage Uber has a track record of refusing to pay large fares I would inevitably have to fight Uber to get paid I would be risking driving  miles   hours round trip for no pay and could also be out of pocket  for gas

c Offer the pax a cash upfront deal

Advantage Uber would be cut out of the deal therefore no risk of being screwed over by Uber and not getting paid

Disadvantage The amount that the pax would likely agree to would be less than 

I can tell you that I did not choose option b With those three red flags setting off down the highway and hoping for the best would be like watching granny porn something that you just dont do

 A grocery pickup in a Chinese supermarket It looks like knowing the Chinese language is a prerequisite for delivery drivers now

 We all know Walmart pickup is never worth the effort Groceries pick up is not the case There was a  bonus per delivery and the first customer left me a  tip Walmart staff brings the items to your car but you need to bring every bag to the customers door If your customer lives in an apartment complex then you are ed which I was ed by the nd delivery  no tip

 As the message indicates the customer planned the delivery too early for her friend Normally I would not have waited particularly with the famous line I will tip you later She then called me saying that her friend was walking back home from the hospital Something inside me told me to wait This RN did keep her promise and gave me  cash",0.9084,0.023,0.889,0.088,Positive,0.09,0.0,0.23,0.41,0.27,2020,MyJessicaLS430
"About half an hour ago I pulled into a McDonalds across from the east Towne mall in Madison an area with a sharp increase in panhandling recently I stopped in to use the bathroom then planned to get breakfast at the drive thru vs at the counter due to spiking COVID cases

As I exited the building a middle aged man was screaming obscenities at a car that was pulling around to the drive thru He asked me if I worked there perhaps because my outfit today looks somewhat like that of a McDonalds employee in the dark to which I answered no dude He mocked me then continued his cell phone conversation

I went through the drive thru and got my breakfast The car he had screamed at was right in front of me Dashcam ready I was preparing myself mentally to witness a fight After I got my food I pulled into a parking spot windows cracked to eat my food and wait for a ping The guy was still there so I locked my doors

He started to explain himself I asked why he had screamed at the car and he said the driver had swerved deliberately to hit a cat He said he was a father of four a school teacher and a cat lover Not everyone is a panhandler not everyone is a criminal he went on He mentioned something about staying in Sun Prairie and that hed give me  for gas money because he cant afford a taxi Apparently he was asking for a ride which I verbally questioned and he confirmed Something about needing a jump and calling the policeI didnt quite follow Imagine yourself in my situation he said

I briefly considered this proposition at least transporting him for free for insurance reasons then realized everything that could go wrongmost notably contracting the Rona I simply have too much to lose even if his motives were pure There was too much that didnt add up If hes a school teacher why does he need help Why was he near east Towne several miles from Sun Prairie Why would he offer me  If he had a phone why didnt he request an Uber

He seemed mentally unstable and his story didnt make sense I told him I cant do it and he said thanks anyway as I pulled out of the parking lot This sounded eerily like the God bless you anyway that some panhandlers say to me when I refuse them Yes I am a heartless monster

So my question to you is is this a new type of scam Ive been hearing the one about needing gas money to see my family in MilwaukeeChicago for years but a scheme in which the person offers ME money",0.1766,0.051,0.899,0.05,Negative,0.05,0.08,0.18,0.26,0.43,2020,MadTownUberD
"Yesterday evening I get a ping at a local resort pull up and see six people standing in a group One walks up to may car and says they ordered  cars can I wait a minute for the other driver to show up se they can see who will fit where I say sure are you Jeff He says no I am Gary Jeff is right here Im like okay this car is for Jeff so Jeff will need to at least be one of the people that ride in my car They ask why and I explain that in the past I have had negative experiences when there are multiple drivers and the person ordering the ride does not ride with me 

The other driver shows up and Jeff and Gary both get in my car with someone else and the other driver gets the  other people We are going to a restaurant about  miles away The other driver rips out around me and pulls out on to the highway I follow much slower We have to head South and make a UTurn to go North

I see the other drivers blinker come on and say hope he is not turning there there is a no Uturn sign and a state trooper sitting right there Sure enough he make a UTurn and before he is even all the way around the trooper turns on his lights and goes after him They ask me to pull over so I do I say this is exactly why I want the person ordering the ride to be in my car if you were in that car you would most likely down rate the ride even though I did not make the illegal UTurn After sitting a few minutes and a phone call to the other car they had me continue to the restaurant 

I drop them off and head back to my staging area and get a ping from Gary Pickup is you guessed it side of the road where the other driver was pulled over Get there and the other  are standing behind the state trooper car waiting for me I pick them up and take them to the restaurant

"Last night I needed a  mile ride in Fort Lauderdale

After putting in the information the quote came back at 
I was ready to confirm the ride but my Visa card had expired and so I had to re enter my new CC and information

This time the Fare came back as  For a  mile ride 
Underneath the quote it said fares may vary significantly during peak or busy times even though a moment earlier it did not
The area was a ghost town Only a few cars here and there
Obviously I declined
Uber probably desperately needed the money but Im not willing to be their sucker They lost the entire fare

Frustrated with the absurdity of Uber I called YellowCab

It was a much quicker online experience and easier process on my phone and the quote for the same ride was  which I accepted
In  minutes the Prius arrived and the driver was very nice
I wasnt even asked about payment and no card or cash was necessary to get into the cab
Super cool guy

I got home payed the driver and tipped him 

Based on this I will probably call YellowCab first from now on
Anyone who accepts a  mile ride for nearly  is crazy And any company who would try that is a failure if not a thief IMO
It was not a peak time and Im sure many drivers could have used that farebut Ubers greed cost everyone involved with Uber
I wonder how many times per day this happens

Uber has lost their way and I cant see their business model lasting much longer They lost California and will likely lose NY soon
Especially when taking a Yellow Cab is less expensive and just as good if not better service
If you are an Uber driver Id start looking for alternative income sources

The only caveat could be if this was a freak incident But I doubt it",-0.9613,0.145,0.762,0.094,Negative,0.11,0.02,0.18,0.27,0.41,2020,NotYetADriver

"FML I was at a complete stop at a redlight on my way to pick up a ride I was rear ended by an SUV that was rear ended by another SUV which in turn pushed me into another car I was in a rental thru uber which is likely a total loss as was the SUV that hit me The at fault party was in a newer higher end SUV The airbags deployed and her radiator was punctured along with severe body damage so it may be a total loss also The car that i hit didnt sustain much damage because i always leave  or  feet between my car and the next at stoplights 

Since there were so many cars involved and I am driving a rental car through Uber the first thing I did was get an attorney The second was to seek medical attention

"It takes a whole lot to get me annoyed but I did a little bit after a conversation Pickup up pax in Chicago wealthy North Shore and drove him downtown He looked like he was in his late twenties We started by talking about young people having a hard time finding work in general Then he suddenly started up with blaming everything on Trump I agreed with him Trump has character flaws He kept going off about how Trump is ruining the country and turning us into a third world nation I often have my guard up completely and walktalk softly when it comes to politics with pax So I tried to be as gentle as possible

I did agree with him that our country has problems but we are a great and wonderful nation He answered back something like No we are a stupid country with stupid people who elected Trump as our president and then said something that somehow irritated me He said something like  And then 

I very carefully pointed out that the US still has the highest immigration by far so there must be at least some people who like to come here And I did point out to him in a respectful way that if he is going to move into another country he has to have moneyand or skills I did ask him what he did for work and he said he was out of work now but his last job was retail in Old Orchard Shopping Center And he did say he lives with his parents and has little money

He said that under Trump the US has lost its status in the world and started demeaning so many things I nicely and kindly pointed out that the US is still leading the world in many areas like high technology Silicon Valley educational institutions like the Ivy League great movies sports and the military He countered a story that I am not right about the military like the Air Force He said when he went to Israel he talked to the Israeli Air Force and said their Air Force was vastly superior to that of the US

So I looked at him in the rear view mirror and asked If there was an plane battle with ALL planes would you take the US Air Force or the Israeli Air Force I just wanted to see what he would sayI know such a thing would never happen between two friendly nations And then he replied that No doubt the Israeli Air Force I pointed out to him that the US Air Force is probably ten times larger I didnt know off the top of my head He responded back But the Israeli Air Force pilots are much better trained To which I replied Maybe I have no idea but the US Air Force is not some third world country trained group and the US probably has hundreds of thousand of planes vs tens of thousands of planes for Israel

At this point I was more curious that someone could be illogical So I pressed a tiny bit more I asked him Then do you think that in the middle of the Pacific if there was an air battle then say  Israeli pilots could take down say  US Air Force pilots I know that such a battle would NEVER occur because the US and Israel are close friends but I asked just for a case example I waited for it and he answered No doubt Id bet on quality over quantity any day So concluded with saying on the subject Sir you may be right that quality is better all things being equal but quantity DOES matter In an air battle over the ocean there are not many places to hide except the clouds I told him that I have no doubt that Israel has an incredibly trained Air Force

The subject came back again to Trump and I wanted to make sure at this point that I didnt upset up because I really dont like to argue with pax When he said that under Obama the economy surged and under Trump the GDP was negative and now plunged I very nicely pointed out the facts I told him that GDP growth was actually positive in every year Trump was in office and the negative GDP numbers was due to Covid I just gently told him that he has valid criticisms about Trump and told him he should tell all his friends to vote As we came towards his destination I steered the conversation into a friendly one about the Chicago Bulls

I dont know about you guys but whenever pax say something TOTALLY illogical I like to carefully steer their logic in the right direction WITHOUT upsetting them I think this is hard to do and maybe it is a lot easier to keep quiet and just nod silently But sometimes driving for a while can get boring And when a pax says something so obviously wrong Ill point to their mistakes In this case I got slightly annoyed and had to check myself when the pax trashed the US the country and its citizens I wondered if he hates it so much he should leave A lot of people would like to come here in spite of all Americas flaws",0.9908,0.109,0.748,0.143,Positive,0.06,0.05,0.33,0.16,0.4,2020,Young Kim
"I responded to a request that was a few minutes out of my way but I didnt mind much It was a gated community but the pin drop was just outside the gates so I waited there I messaged that I was there just in case the pin drop was a mistake and the passenger responds asking if I can wait there He doesnt say when hell be out Weird but whatever Ill wait for  minutes

 minutes go by no one in sight so I noshow the guy Sure enough as soon as I turn around to leave some dude sprints out of the security office and comes running toward my car as I drive away I was parked right in front of the office the entire time within direct view which tells me he knew I was there and just didnt bother to come out I think he just assumed I would wait for as long as he took What a mistake on his part

As I drove away hes screaming for me to stop and my passenger side window was slightly rolled down enough to where I could loudly say Nope and drove off Even as I continued to drive away he was literally screaming for me to stop and even asks if Im an Uber but at this point hes to my back and Im almost at the stop light to turn In situations like this I dont slow my exit because people can be very crazy especially when upset He yelled some profanities I took that right turn at the light and drove off I usually have very little sympathy for people who show such blatant lack of respect for others time

Seconds later as Im driving away I get a ping from the same guy I decline and continue on my way Its not like Im the only Uber around so he can just wait for another driver and hopefully show a little more respect for that drivers time Interesting thing was his rating was a  Just goes to show that even those with high ratings can still show very little care for others time",0.0384,0.119,0.771,0.109,Negative,0.06,0.1,0.35,0.04,0.45,2020,UberFizzle

"Am I losing my mind or is this a Glitch in the Matrix Stuff I witnessed in Uber as a driver is beyond Coincidence I have been doing IT since  and I mainly drive weekends At my IT job I work with a handful of people that I support with tech and app issues There were  people that I believe I had a Glitch in The Matrix What are the odds of that moment All  of these people I managed at one point help with a tech issue or setup a new work laptop for

The first I also happen to somehow get paired with in Uber her friends and herself were downtown when I got the ping and she was surprised she got me as her driver She is one I also usually help stuff with periodically at the IT job and she is my coworker there 

nd person I picked up her friends and herself too at a southern city that is  minutes away from where we work I am rarely at this city as it is farther away from where I live in She was also my coworker and I assisted her numerous times

Third person is a man and I picked him up from his house and took him to airport He is also my coworker who I interacted with at IT job numerous times


It doesnt end there


In Uber I picked up exactly the same group of people A husband and his wife and a short guy who makes funny jokes who I clearly  remember driving the previous year and here is the shocker both the precious and current year I took them to same concert at Surly and they happened to request when I was the only driver near them Uber only pairs by closest driver to you I happened to be in Golden Valley again and near them when they requested so it is as if they had some higher self psychic ability to know I was nearby and they requested me at just the right time


Then there is a Doctor who told me she is Jewish and she is rich too she owns a MultiMillion dollar house And everytime I am passing by i and right before I miss her exit she just happens to ping me as if some higher self in her has psychic ability and knows exactly when to request to get me when her subconscious knows I am nearby and gives her idea to ping me She got mw  different times 

And we are talking about a city of  Million people here with at least  Uber drivers and even more Lyft drivers

It doesnt end there There was  day where I had Mike Michael passengers back to back for about  hours what are the odds of seeing Mike or Michael back to back nonstop

Then there was a day where I drove a Vikings Football player from airport and as a gift he gave me nice expensive headphones then that same evening I also happen to drive another important person A Professional Hockey player for VanCouver who I drove to Hotel so he can stay there for his upcoming game next day and he was a rich guy too I am like how do I a regular Uber manage to drive Rich sports people

Then there are about  teens in a nearby city who are college kids and they somehow request exactly perfect timing to get me on random times and days so what are the odds of that I drove them about  times on various random hours and days when I arrived near wherever new location they were That should not have happened as there are many other drivers that would be closer to them than I am",0.9937,0.009,0.898,0.093,Positive,0.16,0.13,0.19,0.09,0.44,2020,Ozzyoz

"Dropped off pax on Labor Day yesterday  minutes into the ride he asked me to pull over The door opened and he got out And then the vomiting started Ive had many pax vomit before but this one was particularly vulgar Five minutes of heavy vomiting on the street and sidewalk It was sort of funny when a couple of other cars saw him when cars stopped at a traffic light and they were yelling out to him sort of laughing He kept on apologizing to me over and over and I told him it was fine and weve all been there dont worry

He was hunched over for a while looking dizzy and I was afraid this may turn into an Uber Ambulance ride I knew he lost a lot of fluid because his was a projectile vomiting followed by dry heaving when it gets so awful that in the last few nothing comes out I tried not to look but when I checked on him it was a sight to see It was all over the street and sidewalk and there was  hanging out of his mouth From experience I have a vomit kit That is  paper towels  vomit bag if he gets sick again  breath mints  water bottles and  a vitamin tablet and aspirin I threw a jug of a gallon water container onto the vomit to disperse it and then I gave out all the items and he was extremely grateful he was white as a sheet but we continued the  minute ride that ended at Jefferson Park train station Naturally the paper towels stayed out of my car

I made certain that there was no vomit on the back of his clothes before he came back in my car but I knew some had to be on the front of his clothes because he smelled wretched smelled of death really it was THAT bad After the doors closed all the windows came down I tried not to gag myself His was a type of vomit that had a terrible acid like scent very common I guess So I breathed through my mouth After he left I did inspect his seat and there was no visible vomit but the terrible scent lingered I have always  full cans of air freshener so I made sure I spray bombed his seat and the back completely Today it doesnt seem to smell and I found he tipped me  and change on the app",-0.9218,0.098,0.829,0.073,Negative,0.07,0.02,0.18,0.36,0.38,2020,Young Kim

Ignoring the punching down racism and framing of this former query its edited above and Im not linking to the closed thread But Ill bite

Why Do I Drive when I do NOT NEED the Money

For one I have a hyper efficient vehicle EV so maintenence and fuel costs are minimal even as mileage is racked up on my vehicle which doubles as our family car
For another I have a mild case of insomnia A Night Owl by nature and used to channel the late hours watching reading and writing There is precious little income in it particularly FILMwriting but it allowed me to travel the festival circuit for a while as an accredited film critic After nearly  years of obsessive movie watching and  years of freelancing podcasting and generally other contributions for the love of cinema I figured I would get my eyes off the screen and onto humanity Yea in part Im in it for the masochism  Im not a tourist though I have logged a serious number of rides on both platforms have participated on the LYFT Driver Advisory Council LDAC and tangled with the latenight bar crowd often and occationally the commuter rush

There is no greater STEW of humanity than RideHail Pax outside of public transit Pax and I wasnt becoming a bus driver the dayjob has to pay the bills I only do people though not interested in shucking around food or Amazon packages

Flexibility of the GigApps and low barrier to entry allows for more utilization of a depreciating asset and the tax writeoffs when stacked against my Professional Day Job are pretty good Ride hail  Dayjob brings my income into  figures whereas DayJob alone is close but no cigar So yea the pennies help

"Tron reporting in from an undisclosed location I remain evacuated from home base due to a smoke allergy Found a relatively smokefree hideout within the state Bivouacked at a cheap motel Ubering and Lyfting daily to pay travel expenses The area has a reasonable amount of rideshare demand and is slightly underserved enabling a reasonable gross of  last week

Was driving the day UL threatened to shut down rideshare rather than obey the judges order to convert drivers to employees What a mess and what terrible timing Im sure this has been discussed ad infinitum but the drama of that day is likely the best PR move UL could have made to promote Californias proposition  which is slated for a November vote Many passengers had been informed ride sharing was shutting down at midnight and were not happy As with smartphones and Air BBs many cant live without Uber

I am reluctantly suggesting to my pax to vote YES on prop  Damn it

So here is a postcard One memorable trip was with Eva She did not even get in the car but I remember the ride Upon arriving at the pickup she ran up to the car from a lively courtyard a large and apologetic smile on her face She was a goddess Light in complexion and light on her feet The kind of woman a man would lasso the moon for

Turns out she had called a car for her two drunk male party guests Figures But Eva had played it respectfully by first coming out to the car and asking permission for her two inebriated friends to be driven home She spent a minute or two breaking down the situation insisting that her men were not so far gone as to get sick on the trip That assertion plus Evas sincere effort to make everyone happy was enough to gain my acquiescence And although I was memorized by her magical gaze I maintained enough presence of mind to reserve the right to refuse service once the two tipsy curmudgeons came in to view

Eva smiling and gushing thank yous turned and ran to fetch the soon to be passengers At about  feet from the car I spoke the words Eva the Diva in a normal tone of voice She heard the utterance stopped momentarily did a  twirl smiled and curtseyed before continuing  couldnt help but smile

The ogars appeared struggled with their masks for a moment and poured themselves into the car Once seatbelts had been fastened we were off It turned out that the men had standing in the community Both Eva and one of the men had quietly tipped me off that I was driving the DA for the city of  home Not the assistant DA  DA The gentleman tipping me off to that fact had an interest in a couple of the most renowned restaurants in the locale I am servicing None the less they both behaved like beligerant high school kids on the drive Ha ha At one point restaurant man offered me as much as  to allow him to remove his mask I repeatedly declined and both men let out an astonished gasp when they realized I could not be bought

The two men were being dropped at differing destinations They argued about who was going to give the driver a cash tip In the end neither did Eva had warned me in her backgrounder that Theyre aholes Before ending the trip I broke character and texted Eva that her guests had been delivered safe and sound and neither of them had tipped When I later checked the ride history a  tip had been added

"This evening I delivered  pizzas to a mansion in the Memorial Villages which is an upscale residential district in Houston TX My customer Steve called me saying that his place is difficult to find in dark While I used to have a number of decent rides from the Memorial Villages this is my first time to be in the area after sunset He told me to specifically look for the mailbox XXX and take the driveway beside it Can you picture yourself illuminating almost every mailbox on a poorlylit road with a phone

Somehow I managed to find the said mailbox Locating his mansion has then become a lot easier the only mansion with lights on and he was waiting outside As I was unloading he asked can you drive me to Trader Joe to grab some beer He offered me  upfront What a surprise The trip including waiting time took about  minutes one way  miles On the way back he added a brief stop at an ATM and gave me another  After he thanked me for the ride here came the classic line I will take care of you in the app As of this moment the promised tip for pizza delivery has not shown up yet

"Perhaps the behaviours below are a part of TX culture I cant help but to curse those who use the road improperly


A considerable number of drivers do not accelerate to match highway speeds which defeats the purpose of entrance ramps Cars therefore pile up hence increases both the difficulty and risk for drivers behind to merge Moreover this is also the cause of congestion of feeder roads


Why dont plan ahead Whose fault it is to miss an exit Texans please be considerate Use the next available exit if you miss yours Some even have the nerve to cross multiple lanes to exit from the far left without signalling Such selfish and reckless act can lead to a chain of accidents Is sparing a few minutes of time really worth the consequence to bear legal and financial responsibilities for collisions and subsequent injuries if not death


Most highways covering the rural areas have signs that read no trucks on left or left lane only for passing I always wanted to drive a tank to crush those older Prius  Corolla Uhaul vans and even  wheelers occupying the far left lane Most of the time these vehicles travel below the speed limit which is extremely annoying A lot of sections of I toward Dallas have been under construction for donkeys years leaving only  lanes available How do you feel if you were behind a vehicle on the left lane that is travelling at  mph in parallel with the adjacent vehicle while the limit is  mph


It is already ridiculous enough on the right lane This dangerous behaviour imposes more threat to the left lane traffic Drivers behind may misjudge the speed and fail to slow down accordingly Whats worse the driver behind may attempt to swerve to a preoccupied adjacent lane Not sure whose fault it is The person driving below the speed limit or the driver who swerve as an evasive manoeuvre If those people are not confident to drive the speed limit take a bus or request a Uber From my point of view driving too slow is far worse than reasonable speeding


Thankfully Houston is not a city for walking or cycling but I do have a few encounters To name a few joggers crossing a road under orange pedestrian lights students in a group marching at their own pace housewives crossing multiple lanes from one side to another with kids cyclists without a green arrow light expect oncoming traffic to yield etc They certainly have the freedom to die but definitely not the right to get innocent drivers involved

For me I vote  for the most despicable road usage Please feel free to name any behaviours that your despise of Enjoy your evening",-0.9846,0.16,0.739,0.1,Negative,0.1,0.08,0.16,0.26,0.4,2020,MyJessicaLS430

Its horrible especially in light of warrants not being used either anymore and all of the so called secret courts and such

"Got a ping tonight Saturday nightSunday at  am in Cicero IL pax name M She was going to th and the Dan Ryan in the South Side of Chicago a  minute ride She came into my car and asked what radio station I am tuned into I told her easy listening  what you would hear at the dentists office She said she loved it and asked me to turn up the volume which I did Then she told me she was drunk and asked if she could drink out of her bottle I did inform her of the laws Then the desultory and strange conversation started First she kept on asking me if I was a cop I told her no and that it would be silly for an undercover police officer to pose as an Uber driver She then asked me if I am going to take her to prison upon which I again said no She asked this multiple times as well

She asked all about my musical tastes and I told her all genres and she kept talking about her favorite music groups Then she started asking me about my religion when she saw my cross and tried to make a connection She went through how she was kicked out of Catholic school and is now a Lutheran M told me repeatedly during the ride that she was currently running away from her husband that he was crazy and she needed to get away She didnt have a job She kept on telling me that I should never get married and that marriage is a disaster She then asked me my age and I told her  and she said Too bad I am  The passenger I would say did not seem at all drunk and I did not see or smell any bottle of liquor 

Then she told me her pivotal moment in her life positive was when she found the Holy Spirit and Jesus M then told me her lowest point when she was  months pregnant with her son who is now  she was intoxicated with alcohol and got into a car crash on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and was arrested She had to be induced for labor and then DCFS Department of Children and Family Services took away her son for a while Then she told me her life story which was full of tragedy

Then she said a few things which were so strange and somewhat funny During the ride I patiently listened and tried to be a good listener She cried momentarily because she said I was so understanding and she that we had a deep connection When I told her that I had an older sister by  years she replied Whoa That is crazy How did THAT happen I thought to myself silently Well because my parents had intercourse two years before me And at the end of the ride she said she would not leave my car and kept talking asking me if she could request me again I had another ride stacked after so I politely told her I must leave M then said Then please tell me a parting Bible verse that you like which could help me I thought for just a moment after her difficult life and I replied Hebrew  They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best but God disciplines us for our good in order that we may share in his holiness Her face lit up and she said the verse really helped her she left the car saying that she and I will meet againand that she would request me again

 Cap on the number of drivers at say December  numbers Active driver numbers can only go up in proportion to number of rides given yearonyear For example if Ubers ride figures for June  are  higher than they were in June  then Ubers total active driver count can only be increased by  over what it was in June  This would allow the service to grow while not increasing driver saturation

"Apparently when ahole passengers dont want to comply with COVID mandates wearing facecoverings  or properly wearing one AND KEEPING IT ON andor cant or dont put in the correct address into the APP then berate you when you call them to mitigate the error which again is their mistake and as they all talk over one another on speakerphone as if youre their personal property Oh my God Julie shes so stupid  like that Lyft allows these passengers to file health violations on you without fair process no investigation and no tools to help protect us against such false allegations Anyone else 
This health violations against me as a driver is received and processed by Lyft as if true with no statement of facts no evidence and no proof mind you If Im an independent contractor  wouldnt Lyfts processes here be a major overreach and not at all legal If Im an employee wouldnt Lyft need to provide a fair and just process to investigate these claims Once again Lyft cherrypicks processes and policies that do not reflect or support how they have unilaterally chosen to categorize drivers as independent contractors as they simultaneously choose mechanisms that control how we do our job which includes very inequitable policies and actions brought upon us that are not supported by their claims that we are independent If Im independent let me set my own ratesand so onif Im independent then Lyft CANT dictates these things as if Im their employee Right 
In the case with the wrong address today I never even met these women I never saw them and they never saw me as far as their statements about how I was in the wrong place goes I was at the exact placepin on the map according to the Lyft APP yet apparently that was the wrong location And I never did figure out exactly where they were due to the talking over one another the speakerphone on the street etc Yet when I an independent contractor respond to their rudeness and perhaps their stupidity after several minutes trying to ascertain their location and fielding their many overlapping conversations directions addresses up until the attitude began to get more directly ruder etc and then finally inform them that I would be canceling the ride due to that rudeness the account holder beats me to it and cancels then apparently nearly immediately I receive a health violation alert that threatens to suspend my account How can I get a health violation from an account holder that I never saw or met and who never saw me Easy Lyfts processes and policies are strictly for their benefit only  so they look good as they throw us under the bus

Making things worse is the fact that Lyft has made responding to these allegations quite laborious difficult and timeconsuming  for which I do not get paid for btw  and for the fact that these bogus allegations are threatening our livelihood and our emotional and mental states its been VERY UPSETTING VERY This is negligent and punitive in my estimation I have had to take time off of the platform to process and respond to these claims which have had very negative effects on me and my income Im actually frightened to go back out there afraid of what someones going to do next Its so risky as it is and now this I feel maligned disregarded and without value of any kind Of course Lyft has contributed to this with other actions and choices prior to COVID its just much more dicey and scary now COVID has definitely amplified the disfunction and negligence of and from Lyft Since COVID Ive had a passenger throw a drink at me hitting my car for which nothing was really done and I had no available recourse Ive been threatened many times Ive had many people take their masks off in the car one woman did her makeup while breathing on me Ive been lied to every which way you can imagine given all sorts of promises from passengers that they then fail to fulfill that have either put me directly at risk or took adavantage of me in some way and generally l get treated like a piece of sht more and more and my vehicle is getting thrashed But Lyft has no process to mitigate those things And they dont care either

Ive had about  of these kinds of health violation retaliations in the last few weeks Its feeling VERY personal and vindictive st one Lyft said it was their bad Great Of course I had to take a week off due to that because I was so upset about the false allegation They offered no details The nd one I have no idea where that stands as Lyft has not been communicating with me and quite frankly they make these processes VERY difficult and laborious for which I do not get paid to unravel I have no details on that one either Took some time off for that one too but went back sooner because Ive lost so much income already Then I get todays I feel like I have no choice but to do whatever anyone wants to do to me or my car which is my personal property no matter how degrading upsetting scary or unfair it is if I want the privilege to earn on this platform I hate this

Im just beside myself here I fear for my life every time I go out there on the platform whether its from COVID or from the bad actions of passengers and the lack of action and fairness from and by Lyft Im a sitting duck

Im wondering how others are fairing and if anyone has any connections to attorneys in Los Angeles who could help

PS And heres the doozie Dont forget that Lyft does NOT mandate that passengers use their real and true names or use a recent real and true photo of themselves nor are passengers backgrounds checked  yet theyre allowed on the platform and into our personal vehicles that we use for ourselves our families and our friends and loved ones and these passengers can wield any accusation against us with Lyftprotected impunity Meaning we have no recourse should anything happen to us or our property or if false claims are alleged  no precautions no process no equity Further when account holders bring along friends or allow family members to use their accounts those passengers also do not have to comply with a real and true name today I picked up someone named Diagnostics  not her actual name photo or background checks If Im doing business with someone as an independent contractor or at all you better bet that I want and will insist on having individuals actual true real names and contact information Why are we not given even that minimal amount of respect That weakens us That invalidates us Lyft has sold us out and set us up for solely their gain which is made btw upon the backs of each and every one of us while they make all the rules and policies disenfranchise us and use us up and spits us out And if we are a victim of any of these passengers in any way we have zero ways of gaining a remedy or a way to be made whole again  simply due to HOW Lyft has set this up and how they dictate this relationship must and will occur I doubt Lyft does or would do business with folks who dont provide valid company and personal information to them as that would legally stupid Yet thats how theyve set us up The bottom line is Drivers take on the majority of risk without any agency protections or back up We have no benefits and no path to equitable process either Something to think about

I dropped off pax who lived right next to a cemetery She told me that she and her family always go on walks together inside the cemetery I told her that when I Uber during the daytime I often drop by the cemeteries to park take a walk and recharge There is just so much peace inside a cemetery Ill often go inside them and walk and read the gravestones during the daytime It takes away from the stress of driving Ill just look at some of the oldest dates what was happening in the world at that time Then I can better reflect on my own life knowing that whatever problems I perceive I may have time takes care of everything,-0.4256,0.115,0.807,0.077,Negative,0.0,0.07,0.27,0.27,0.4,2020,Young Kim

Had a nice conversation with a pax who does Uber and does massages for a living She was quite young and she said that doing part time gigs allows her to travel whenever she wantedfor at least half of the year She is single and wishes to remain so never plans to have kids rents and lives very very cheaply She does Uber and books her clients in between trips We discussed how flights and motel stays can be had for a bargain nowadays There is the risk of infection but she is not worried I found her strategy of living quite refreshing She doesnt want to wait til retirement to enjoy travel because she said she would be unable to move around as freely because of a less strong body Does anyone take advantage of the freedom of being an ant and travel much on a shoestring budget And if so where would you go during this time We went over some of her living arrangements like sharing a rented apartment with  other people and never eating out always cooking and it was amazing how far she went to fund her lifestyle,0.9896,0.014,0.801,0.185,Positive,0.23,0.05,0.18,0.14,0.41,2020,Young Kim

"Ive been job hunting for another job besides rideshare and it hasnt been going very well

Even though Im making good money and Im happy being a rideshare driver I feel like I should have a real job something with benefits

So Ive been going around and interviewing at different places that are looking for help

Of course I have a  demands

I let them know that I only want to work when I feel like it Whenever I decide I want to stop working I can just go into last customer mode and stop working

Also if I am uncomfortable with a customer or they make me feel safe I dont want to have to let them in the store

And if theyre already inside and they make me feel uncomfortable or feel unsafe I want to be able to throw them out

I also let them know that when theres a lot of customers I feel that I should get some kind of a bonus a surge if you will

If I help three customers in a row I should get a bonus

If I help a lot of customers in a week I should get a bonus

"California has been up in arms about Uberlyfts failure to classify its drivers as employees However California should accept at least part of the blame for the problems that it alleges for the simple reason that it allowed Uberlyft to exist in the first place in spite of the fact that the companies early operations broke California law

When Uberlyft appeared the only way to transport pax on demand was with a taxi It was not possible to transport pax on demand for less than taxi rates Then Uberlyft emerged and started their operations charging pax fares that they themselves set with no minima imposed on them Of course the public loved being driven around for half the cost of a taxi In the face of public opinion California acquiesced and changed its laws to accommodate Uberlyft effectively deregulating on demand forhire transportation

We know what happened in the taxi industry before regulation in the early part of the last century Increasing numbers of taxis pushed fares lower and lower until it got to a point where drivers were not making enough money to survive on or pay for basics such as being able to take time off or being able to afford health care Sound familiar Fast forward to the s and we have a repeat of that scenario Deregulation of forhire vehicles has led to everincreasing numbers and oversupply of Uberlyft drivers which in turn allowed Uberlyft to reduce driver rates to the extremely low levels they are currently at 

Now California complains that drivers are unable to make a living working for these companies but it shows no sign of realising that it allowed this to happen What did California expect when it deregulated the forhire transportation industry disregarding the rates it sets for taxis and allowing the rideshare companies to flood the market with cars at whatever prices they like It shows a tremendous lack of foresight",-0.8944,0.096,0.869,0.034,Negative,0.08,0.05,0.24,0.27,0.35,2020,The Gift of Fish
"Even during the longest economic expansion in recent times  throughout an ideal boom economy Uber was unable to make even  in profit But now the boom is well and truly over and global economies are crashing Ubers rideshare business has been decimated and its losses are growing larger than ever On top of all that California and New York two of Ubers largest markets are about to force Uber to pay employee benefits for their drivers Its not looking good

Uber currently has bn remaining in cash and cash equivalent assets Its current cash burn rate is bn per quarter At this rate Uber will run out of money in about a year Conveniently Dara says that Uber will be profitable by Q  about a year from now However Uber has missed all other promises of profit that its ever made And those promises were made  and broken  back when the economy was booming Dara has given no information on how Uber will reach profitability within the year It actually looks now like the end of Uber may finally be in sight

Can Uber suddenly and magically find a path to profit in spite of all of the above before the money runs out How Or are they just rearranging the deck chairs at this point

It was obvious it was the first time he used Uber as he asked me several questions on how to use it

We get talking and he was upset there was no limo service available and the resort he booked avg  per night was a dump He took a limo from the airport to the resort I ask him where he was visiting from and he tells me Nigeria I laugh to myself Nigerian Prince they do exist His destination is another high end resort that charges around  per night

Really nice guy mainly just talked about things to do while he was in town for a week and what my favorite restaurants were He wanted to go offshore fishing so I gave him a card for one of the captains I know the card has a unique identifier on it and every  offshore trips booked from my identifier earns me a free  day offshore trip I have done  fishing trips now

He dropped me a  tip been a while since I got a  tip think that makes my rd in the nearly  years I have been doing ride share I suspect I wont get anymore rides from him as the resort I took him to has their own car service

"Looking at all the threads complaining on here about tips Ill share my history being a bad tipper

Late searly s Dominos had a if its not delivered in  or  minutes forget which its free We would be complete clowns and block the streets to get free foodnever thinking of the driver who got no tip This ended when a coworker had a husband that had delivered to me several timesouch

As an adult if I called a place for delivery and they said  minutes I would be fine unless it was late then no tip The same goes for calling back and asking if they were running behind when they said  minutes and now its  minutes and they say another  minutes and the driver shows up in another hourno tip 

Asking for something thats really important to me like hot mustard for Chinese food or blue cheese for wings Ill stress and stress that I need extra hot mustard if none I cant eat that garage and dont tip Sort of like going to a bar and asking for a Jack and coke and the Jack didnt come but they can bring it back in  minutes 

So basically if you delivered to me you had zero  chance of determining your tip Aside from being weird and mowing my yard everyone else set you up for failure or my base tip of  and much more in crappy weather for a  minute delivery 

Just food for thought if you get a bad tip it prolly might not be your fault 

Ill extend my thought process to inside dining If the waitstaff says service might be a little slow or very slow because of this or that like short staff they get a full and nice tip If they say nothing and we complain several times over what should be a  minute dining experience that turns into  hours the tip will suffer The ONLY thing that can really hurt the tip of a waitperson is being the type that knows they will earn  and they just dont care anything about servicethen they get a nice long winded note explaining exactly why they got the tip left

There a few younger boys playing outside like middle school age The girl just walks over and picks up one of their bikes and they are like Hey what are you doing and she rides away and they try and chase after her but give up So I am like wtf So I get out of the car and knock on the door The same door the girl just exited from a few minutes ago A woman in her s I think answers the door I ask her about the delivery She said no one ordered food and that there was no one by that name living there I asked her if she had a daughter or younger family member that lived there with them or was staying there and she said no I explained to her that a girl just exited her house that looked like the person I just described and the woman got very worried and said that she had no one in the house today besides her that she knows of Well ok

I start to walk back to my car and those boys are outside yelling and freaking out and one of the kids dads are there So as I am getting in my car I ask them if they knew who the girl was The one boy said No And she just stole my bike

So I drive away and before I contact support I get a text and its the girl She asked if I left and I said yes She says meet me at the park a few blocks down I head over and she asks for her shoes back and the food I give them to her and she gives me a  cash tip She then gets back on the bike with her shoes on and the food and just disappears

I completed the delivery on the app then moved on No idea what the hell that was even about This was not some trashy looking girl or a girl who looked like she was on drugs or used drugs I cant even begin to assume what was up there",-0.7727,0.071,0.857,0.073,Negative,0.04,0.08,0.4,0.15,0.33,2020,The Jax
