# Uber-Community-Sentiment-Analysis-during-Covid

# Introduction
As unicorns grow, people have started to contemplate the existence of the gig economy's dark side. Particularly, the public debate has concentrated on the labor conditions of gig workers â€• self-employed individuals whose behavior is constrained by the algorithms behind the business models operated by prominent companies such as Airbnb, Deliveroo, or Uber.

# Problem
Examine a corpus of text containing the messages Uber drivers exchange in the UberPeople forum. There are three operational goals to pursue:

1)To appreciate the set of themes Uber drivers talk about.\
2)To appreciate the affective states represented in talks among Uber drivers.\
3)To appreciate how themes and affective states change over time/different stages of development of Uber.\


# Solution
1)To appreciate what Uber drivers talk about, we chose to analyse the Stories forum under Community.\
2) We performed Web Scrapping on 25 pages.\
3)Compared what topics have been shared the most in 2020 when Covid first started and what stories have been shared in 2021 were restrictions eased.\
4)Sentiment Analysis to see how the emotions of Stories change over the years.\
Used topic modeling to pursue goal #1.\
Used sentiment analysis to pursue goal #2.\
carry out some statistical post-processing on the outcome of the topic modeling and sentiment analysis to pursue goal #3
